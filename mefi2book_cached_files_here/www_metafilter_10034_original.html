The plane crashed into the building about six  minutes ago, from what the TV is saying. We are about sixty blocks north and we can see the smoke over the skyline.<br>

A plane impacted the top of one of the WTC towers at about 10 minutes to nine this morning.  While everybody was still trying to figure out was was going on, a second plane flew in a straight line into the second tower and impacted it at a height a little lower than the first collision.  Both building are clearly on fire.  The government has apparently received no warning or claims of an attack.  The president will address the nation shortly.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/803" target="_self">iceberg273</a> at <a href="/10034/Plane-crashes-in-to-the-word-trade-center#128457" target="_self">6:28 AM</a>  on September 11, 2001 </span></div><br><br>

<a name="128564"></a><div class="comments">The plane crashed about 11 miles south of Jennerstown, PA which isn't a huge town, but isn't small.  There's a race track (auto racing) there.  It was a 747 (no word on which airline yet, on local Pittsburgh news) and as reported, was Cleveland --> Chicago bound but also hijacked.  No word on whether there is any possibility of survivors, but that is the central PA mountain area (ski resorts, etc.) so the terrain is probably working against them.  Downtown Pittsburgh has essentially emptied out, the USX Tower (our tallest building) and the government buildings have been evacuated.<br />

I am only a block from the White House.  There are currently two layers of security around the white house from what I can see.  There is an outer layer has secret service and other police officers to turn back people and cars, and an inner on complete with road blocks.  <br />
<br />
Since air traffic has been stopped, it has been quieter than usual.  The endless string of planes flying into national airport has disappeared.  Occasionally, you can hear a rumbling overhead, probably fighter jets circling the city.<br />
<br />
Traffic in DC is at a stand still.  Quite a few federal workers have given up on driving home.  You can see them mingling with the homeless people and listening to transistor radios in the parks that sprinkle the area from the Watergate Complex to the White House.  Some people look scared, but most look pretty calm, like this happens every lunch hour.<br />
<br />
There are lots of people standing around, people talking, people smoking cigarettes.  This is something you never see in DC, a place where people never seem to get where they're going fast enough.  But with the bridges to Virginia blocked and the Metro skipping some stops, we all suddenly have time to stand around and listen.<br />

The secret service seems to be eyeing me nervously, they've moved the security perimeter beyond where I'm sitting, so I think I'll go home and post this.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/7842" target="_self">Alison</a> at <a href="/10034/Plane-crashes-in-to-the-word-trade-center#128695" target="_self">11:00 AM</a>  on September 11, 2001 [<a href="/favorited/2/128695" style="font-weight:normal;" title="3 users marked this as favorite">3 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<a name="128709"></a><div class="comments">This goes beyond terrorism to a form of asymmetrical warfare. The response to such an attack must be as definite and strong as any one would give in open battle. If countries such as Afghanistan, Yemen and Iraq are willing to harbor known terrorist organizations, they must also be willing to suffer the consequences of those associations. And, if this attack is state sponsored, the US must considered itself at war. <br />
<br />
Regardless of blame, America will fundamentally change because of these acts. The very freedoms which define the nation will have to be reconsidered, and, if needed, changed. Such a change to a society goes beyond the material loss by forcing a consideration of a nation's sense of identity.<br />
<br />
For this inevitable loss, coupled with what will surely be a horrendous loss of life, we must all grieve. I am not an American nor am I given to slogans, but I do hope that today, and for many days hereafter God blesses America in all that it will have to endure.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/10413" target="_self">sunsolid</a> at <a href="/10034/Plane-crashes-in-to-the-word-trade-center#128709" target="_self">11:16 AM</a>  on September 11, 2001 </span></div><br><br>

Regarding Rebecca's (and others') view that it might behoove the US to examine itself and what it has done to create enemies with such determined hatred; I think it's worth reflecting that many people in many countries (including its 'allies') have serious issues with the way the US comports itself on the world stage.  It's no use announcing yourself the world's policeman/woman if the people of the world haven't chosen to be policed by you, and it's got to be galling for a country like the US to suggest that it should be the one taking the moral high ground when some of its moral standpoints are, frankly, repugnant to many people.<br />

clean up will be a tremendous task. the buildings are too hot to even approach, meaning searches could take a week or more. groundwater will likely be contaminated, meaning fresh reservees will have to be shipped in. disposal will be a huge task, calling for even more traffic to and from the area.<br />
<br />
as if the initial attack wasn't bad enough, the physical reminder will exist in new york for quite some time.<br />

i'm wondering if they will even rebuild the buildings. it is definately an eerie change to the new york skyline. that is, when the debris settles, and the skyline is fully visible again.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/9979" target="_self">mich9139</a> at <a href="/10034/Plane-crashes-in-to-the-word-trade-center#128768" target="_self">12:47 PM</a>  on September 11, 2001 </span></div><br><br>

I think Rebecca is right to worry about our civil liberties.

I'm not sure how many people were in the building at the time, but a press conference with giuliani and pataki named the number of wounded being treated after the WTC strike. As far as I can recall, they mentioned 1600 walking wounded, 600 hospitalized in stable condition, and 150 hospitalized in critical condition.

My first thought was, this is either Islamic terrorists or some very well-hidden people who want us to think so, whoever might  have something to gain or just want the attendant chaos and potential for martial law-type edicts to be enacted. <br />

I have to go through WTC at least thrice a week. There are at least a few hundred immigrant Muslims who work at the various stores, coffee shops and on the sidewalk. It is very likely that there are just as many dead innocent Muslims/Arabs under the WTC rubble as any other demographic group.<br />

Yes, I was at my desk when the first plane hit 1 wtc.  I heard the explosion/collision, then saw the most terrifying sight of my life falling in front of my windows.  I ran down 30 flights and joined the chaos in the wtc concourse.  I was trying to get out of the wtc when the second plane hit right above the revolving doors I was about to exit through.  <br />
<br />
I fled through a subway transfer tunnel and came out north of wtc.  I went into a thrift shop, tried to make calls (no phone service, cell or other) when I heard comossion and saw people running in terror.  One of those people was [my wife].  I ran her down and went with her and her boss to his apt not far from wtc.  To make a long story short, we're unbelievably shaken.  Were you able to let everybody know what happened?  I got some more emails, so I'm assuming the word has gotten out.<br />

Justice is conscious, hate is unconscious. Hate only begets hate. Don't become subjugated by the terrorist's fear frenzy, and lash out.  Those responsible will be brought to justice. But we win, not when the axe falls on the executioner's block, but when we keep our senses, and the world's principles of democracy and freedom, in focus. Terrorism likes not the cold calculating eye of justice, prefers instead the chaos of panic. <br />

Think about it, that's EIGHTEEN whole minutes! In that span they could have figured out if another plane was on its way (off track etc.) and shot it down. But by God, 18 minutes is a long time.

<br />
Its a shame that although there are 1.2 billion muslims in the world, we are judged by the actions of these terrorists. I get terrible reactions from people sometimes - I think tmrw will indeed be the main point, once people we know to be reasonable and intelligent have had time to think..<br />
<br />
Let me also make the point that if this was a fundamentalist attack by someone like bin Laden, this is <b>not</b> jihad, nor vaguely islamic. Once military jihad has been called, the muslim is barred from killing those that are scholars or part of the infrastructrue of the enemy (as according to the hadith (teachings) of Mohammad (pbuh)). That makes this murder.<br />

   First of all I am not even going to touch the suggestion of killing a few to save 10 x few. That's a very sensitive subject, and has advocates on both sides, with reason. Personally though, I feel that shooting down a plane instead of toppling the WTC is fully justified.<br />

   Eighteen minutes is ample time to get a jet in the sky. Military bases in NYS are on standby 24/7 (interpret "standby" as you wish). So getting a jet up there should not have been particularly difficult. <br />

That was late enough so that, if the original pilots were still in control at gunpoint, they may well known what was going on and have flown into the ground deliberately. "Everyone on this flight is as good as dead, we won't let them use the plane to kill more." <br />

Thus far there is no specific country that seems involved in this act of terrorism... or any other acts of past significance.  No country has appeared and said "Arg!

It is difficult to declare war on someone when there is no one on which to justifiably declare war.  Yes, these countries house terrorists and that is extremely nconvenient... but it is not a direct sign of aggression from their government... not enough to war.<br />
<br />
So this is the problem.  We have little pockets of terrorists sitting in little protective countries, and we cannot act on the terrorists without seriously pissing off the country in question.

I read about an ultrasharp ceramic kitchen knife which would never show up in an x-ray machine (unless metal was added for this purpose.<br />

I just listened to an interview with one of the designers of the WTC towers, who said they have no sprinkler system and were designed such that in the event of a fire, floors would be sealed to contain the fire (with a "safe" area on each floor.  He also said that there was no way people above the floor(s) where a plain entered would have been able to get out.<br />

Also, he clarified that not 50,000, but <i>500,000</i> people work in the WTC.  I know the surrounding area is packed 8:30-9:30 am.  This is staggering.<br />

Remember, the passengers likely had no idea the hijackers were going to intentionally crash the plane. (Correct me if I'm wrong and the cell phone traffic on the planes indicates otherwise.)<br />

So they probably thought their best course of action was to ride it all out and wait for the inevitable negotiations with authorities.

We don’t pay attention to U.S. foreign policy, let alone understand it. We demand nothing from our media other than entertainment, which it provides to the exclusion of all else. We have mediocre schools that do little save train our children to follow the crowd and become more eager consumers. We repress people around the globe because we do not understand them, and worse yet, we increasingly do not understand <i>ourselves</i> and thus commit similar atrocities within our own society."

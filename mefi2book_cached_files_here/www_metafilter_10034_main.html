A plane impacted the top of one of the WTC towers at about 10 minutes to nine this morning.  While everybody was still trying to figure out was was going on, a second plane flew in a straight line into the second tower and impacted it at a height a little lower than the first collision.  Both building are clearly on fire.  The government has apparently received no warning or claims of an attack.

There&#x2019;s a race track (auto racing) there.  It was a 747 (no word on which airline yet, on local Pittsburgh news) and as reported, was Cleveland &#x2013;&gt; Chicago bound but also hijacked.  No word on whether there is any possibility of survivors, but that is the central PA mountain area (ski resorts, etc.) so the terrain is probably working against them.  Downtown Pittsburgh has essentially emptied out, the USX Tower (our tallest building) and the government buildings have been evacuated.<br>

Regardless of your world view, this is barbaric.  <br>
<br>
I don&#x2019;t defend the Palestinians.  It is barbaric to celebrate the deaths of others.  But it&#x2019;s probably worse to propose genocide because of the barbaric actions of the few.  Also, before you do that, you might want to look back through history and see whether any Americans celebrated events that resulted in the deaths of many civilians.  <br>
<br>
I certainly hope that the people who are responsible will be severely punished.  I&#x2019;m just not willing to kill people for their feelings, however barbaric, unless they actually did something to cause the harm.<br><div class="commentName">&#x2014; anapestic</div><div class="spacer">&#x2738;</div></div><div class="comments">Some links that might be of interest:<br>

I am only a block from the White House.  There are currently two layers of security around the white house from what I can see.  There is an outer layer has secret service and other police officers to turn back people and cars, and an inner on complete with road blocks.  <br>
<br>
Since air traffic has been stopped, it has been quieter than usual.  The endless string of planes flying into national airport has disappeared.  Occasionally, you can hear a rumbling overhead, probably fighter jets circling the city.<br>
<br>
Traffic in DC is at a stand still.  Quite a few federal workers have given up on driving home.  You can see them mingling with the homeless people and listening to transistor radios in the parks that sprinkle the area from the Watergate Complex to the White House.  Some people look scared, but most look pretty calm, like this happens every lunch hour.<br>

There are lots of people standing around, people talking, people smoking cigarettes.  This is something you never see in DC, a place where people never seem to get where they&#x2019;re going fast enough.

And, if this attack is state sponsored, the US must considered itself at war. <br>

Regardless of blame, America will fundamentally change because of these acts. The very freedoms which define the nation will have to be reconsidered, and, if needed, changed.

Yes, I was at my desk when the first plane hit 1 wtc.  I heard the explosion/collision, then saw the most terrifying sight of my life falling in front of my windows.  I ran down 30 flights and joined the chaos in the wtc concourse.  I was trying to get out of the wtc when the second plane hit right above the revolving doors I was about to exit through.  <br>
<br>
I fled through a subway transfer tunnel and came out north of wtc.  I went into a thrift shop, tried to make calls (no phone service, cell or other) when I heard comossion and saw people running in terror.  One of those people was [my wife].  I ran her down and went with her and her boss to his apt not far from wtc.  To make a long story short, we&#x2019;re unbelievably shaken.  Were you able to let everybody know what happened?

Justice is conscious, hate is unconscious. Hate only begets hate. Don&#x2019;t become subjugated by the terrorist&#x2019;s fear frenzy, and lash out.  Those responsible will be brought to justice. But we win, not when the axe falls on the executioner&#x2019;s block, but when we keep our senses, and the world&#x2019;s principles of democracy and freedom, in focus. Terrorism likes not the cold calculating eye of justice, prefers instead the chaos of panic. <br>

In other words, they knew as it was happening that it was a rogue flight, so presumably they knew about the other three as well. Maybe they were slow to jump to such a horiffic conclusion and start shooting down domestic flights over US soil. Or maybe they were too slow or hesitant&#x2026; either way, some people knew what was going on as it happened.<br><div class="commentName">&#x2014; kokogiak</div><div class="spacer">&#x2738;</div></div><div class="comments"><a href="http://www.efreak.com/?i=2001_09_01_group_0.html#5620254"><span class="linkfix">Zha</span></a> at efreak<br><div class="commentName">&#x2014; feelinglistless</div><div class="spacer">&#x2738;</div></div><div class="comments">also, in response to Saima, the reactions of people may not be excuseable, but they are understandable. There are a lot of very scared people now, and they are attaching themselves to the rage and stereotypes that come from that fear. <br>
<br>
Its a shame that although there are 1.2 billion muslims in the world, we are judged by the actions of these terrorists. I get terrible reactions from people sometimes - I think tmrw will indeed be the main point, once people we know to be reasonable and intelligent have had time to think..<br>
<br>
Let me also make the point that if this was a fundamentalist attack by someone like bin Laden, this is <b>not</b> jihad, nor vaguely islamic. Once military jihad has been called, the muslim is barred from killing those that are scholars or part of the infrastructrue of the enemy (as according to the hadith (teachings) of Mohammad (pbuh)). That makes this murder.<br>

   First of all I am not even going to touch the suggestion of killing a few to save 10 x few. That&#x2019;s a very sensitive subject, and has advocates on both sides, with reason. Personally though, I feel that shooting down a plane instead of toppling the WTC is fully justified.<br>
<br>
   Eighteen minutes is ample time to get a jet in the sky. Military bases in NYS are on standby 24/7 (interpret &#x201C;standby&#x201D; as you wish). So getting a jet up there should not have been particularly difficult. <br>
<br>
   And finally the Pentagon. Now that is a real disgrace. One hour after the fact, and they can&#x2019;t even secure the airspace. That&#x2019;s 60+ minutes gone by.

the buildings fell like that because of the lattice structure they had - the supports were on the outside, not via pillars, and so the main structural weakness is straight down.

the extremist in me would go as far to suggest that after the pilots have locked themselves in, they can communicate with the cabin but not vice versa. that way no demands can be articulated to them by hi-jackers. the crew could have an alarm to notify the pilots in case of medical emergencies.<br><div class="commentName">&#x2014; centrs</div><div class="spacer">&#x2738;</div></div><div class="comments">centrs, I have a feeling a lot of ideas like those will eventually make it into production.

no. by whom? The thing&#x2019;ll probably be at 50,000 feet - well out of the range of most hand held SAM&#x2019;s. Also, it won&#x2019;t be the only plane in the sky - there&#x2019;ll be loads and loads of fighter&#x2019;s too.<br>

From the tragically ironic quote department: &#x201C;I feel this way about it.

The World Trade Center is a living symbol of man&#x2019;s dedication to world peace &#x2026; beyond the compelling need to make this a monument to world peace, the World Trade Center should, because of its importance, become a representation of man&#x2019;s belief in humanity, his need for individual dignity, his beliefs in the cooperation of men, and through cooperation, his ability to find greatness.&#x201D; - Minoru Yamasaki, chief architect of the World Trade Center<br><div class="commentName">&#x2014; bvadnais</div><div class="spacer">&#x2738;</div></div><div class="comments">Can anyone explain to me why all the talking heads are so convinced that this was a &#x201C;<i>very</i> complicated operation&#x201D; that likely required the resources of a nation-state?<br>

Remember, the passengers likely had no idea the hijackers were going to intentionally crash the plane. (Correct me if I&#x2019;m wrong and the cell phone traffic on the planes indicates otherwise.)<br>

So they probably thought their best course of action was to ride it all out and wait for the inevitable negotiations with authorities.

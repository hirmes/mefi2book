	 I&#x2019;ve created a script that converts a Metafilter thread into a PDF designed for printing in book form, including title page and contributor index.  I used lulu.com to print a few and they look pretty good.

To be clear: I&#x2019;m not selling the books or making the ones I&#x2019;ve created available.

My feeling there is that we&#x2019;re talking about publish as in &#x201C;with intent to sell/distribute&#x201D;, not merely in the sense of &#x201C;cause to take physical form&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s okay to print a thread out on your printer at home; it&#x2019;s okay to print yourself a copy in fancy PDF-ified form from an on-demand press; it&#x2019;s not okay to start a bookstore called Unauthorized Mefi Threads Inc. where you sell bound copies of threads to third parties without explicit permission/license from the folks who commented therein.<br><div class="commentName">&#x2014; cortex</div><div class="spacer">&#x2738;</div></div><div class="comments">Or what cortex said.<br><div class="commentName">&#x2014; gwint</div><div class="spacer">&#x2738;</div></div><div class="comments"><i>now to pick the goofiest post around to print and give as a gift.</i><br>

Yeah, that&#x2019;s a tough one. With automation, it would be a trade off between comments/usernames getting cut off and weird extra space at the bottom of pages.

<br>
Do you have a reasonable expectation that the recipient of that gift would turn around and try to capitalize on it as a resale opportunity or otherwise misuse the gift in a way that violates the spirit of the copyright notice?  If so, do not give it as a gift.  Otherwise, it seems like a non-issue, at least in terms of the copyright/publishing ethics.  Whatever other concerns are tied up in such an idea are their own discussion, I figure.<br><div class="commentName">&#x2014; cortex</div><div class="spacer">&#x2738;</div></div><div class="comments">This is a neat thing you made.<br><div class="commentName">&#x2014; odinsdream</div><div class="spacer">&#x2738;</div></div><div class="comments"><i>Widows and orphans.<br>

<br>
Well, it&#x2019;s not like there&#x2019;s just a simple css rule I can apply&#x2026; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/widows"><span class="linkfix">wait</span></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/orphans"><span class="linkfix">what</span></a>? O_o<br>
<br>
I&#x2019;ll see if I can incorporate those as an optional switch.  &lt;geek&gt;The script relies on the <a href="http://wkhtmltopdf.org/"><span class="linkfix">wkhtmltopdf</span></a> library, which uses WebKit for the heavy lifting html-&gt;pdf conversion, so if that lib supports those css rules, it should be possible.&lt;/geek&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>How do I actually use this script?</i><br>
<br>
Well, unfortunately for now, it can only be used on the command line (i.e. Terminal) and requires you install some additional software, so if you&#x2019;re not comfortable with a little bit of unix, it might be tricky. I might set it up as a webservice if there&#x2019;s really a demand for it, but probably not.<br>

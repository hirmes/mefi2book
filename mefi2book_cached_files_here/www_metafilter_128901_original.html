<a name="5025617"></a><div class="comments">Look, if your understanding is grounded in evidence then believe what you want. The narrative that's written by the EFF timeline pins the paradigm shift in NSA domestic spying <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/wiebe-declaration-support-plaintiffs-motion">on 9/11</a> with its most significant expansions happening during Bush's administration. Obama's problem was in not curbing this expansion and keeping the practice relatively opaque. He chose to focus his attention on healthcare reform and renewable energy and while we all would have loved if he could have lived up to the promise of his campaign, it's not the reality we live in. Those acts were his legacy, one that is undeniably tarnished by the continuation of warrantless wiretapping. But to say that this is the thing that would come to define his presidency reveals a profound ignorance of exactly how much spying has been happening for the last decade and of how incredibly important the ACA was in beginning the process of fixing this shameful excuse of a healthcare system that we have had to live with for so many years.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/111122" target="_self">dubusadus</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5025617" target="_self">1:48 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5025617" style="font-weight:normal;" title="19 users marked this as favorite">19 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br />
I can see why a system like this could be desirable, especially if we end up in another conflict between major world powers.  And obviously a big problem is no President wants to be in a position where they fail to protect the U.S. from another terrorist attack.  The NSA is probably making the case that this is their best tool for preventing one.  I wonder how we could retain it and still protect privacy better than it appears to be, according to Snowden.  Maybe it could be put it entirely under the control of Congress and the Justice Department, rather than the White House.  Maybe there could be engineers and analysts reporting directly to the Justice Department whose soul purpose is to insure that none of the information is accessed except via official queries  into the database, that every query into the database is recorded forever, that any illegal queries are persecuted to the full extent of the law, and that no information from the database can be used for any purpose except counter-terrorism and counter-intelligence.

It seems to me that he played this very smart. Whip up a media frenzy with a critical mass of the public and various high-profile individuals on your side, then run off to a place where you can't just quietly be arrested and locked up -- it looks like the US government would need to move mountains and act very publicly to get its hands on this guy.

I'll be waiting for more in-depth legal analyses from smart sources (Balkin, Kerr, Wittes) before making any judgments about the legality here.  My overall sense is that, while people can disagree w/ his foreign policy judgment all they want, Obama has worked w/in constitutional constraints and hasn't taken positions that aren't too aggressive (with the possible exception of Libya).<br />
<br />
Just facially, there are clear differences for fourth amendment purposes between the type of record here (business records that don't reach content) and the purpose (national security) that both tend to have lower standards for the fourth amendment (ie, reasonable basis v probable cause).

<a name="5025710"></a><div class="comments">The NSA has existed for a long time. Domestic spying then, has existed for a long time, whether or not it was a priority. The most effective time in which to politicize those acts would have been at the founding of the NSA in Truman's era or <em>nearly 20 years later</em> when Ted Kennedy introduced FISA and Jimmy Carter signed off on the first bill that would effectively protect US citizens from being spied on by security agencies. And who remembers Carter for the things he's done now? Were those damn hippies right about the conspiracy apparatus after all? Where were the protests against the Patriot Act? <br />
<br />
Popular support. That was the one thing that was missing. There's something of an unfounded assumption here that this is the legacy of Obama not the legacy we have from the Cold War that has only now come into light. If anything, Obama's is the administration that would most easily keel over to popular political pressure to something like this. Now we know how the drone strikes work legally (sort of) and that was half the battle. Now there's a path for reform and enacting change, not just ineffective anger at some dirty acts carried out by nameless security agencies. Even TBIJ data reports that drone strikes have died down a whole hell of a lot since the Living Under Drones Report garnered some small amount of popular support and led to that rash of reporting.<br />

And the enlisting into the Army with only a GED and then beginning training for Special Forces? I'd like someone with Army knowledge to tell me if that makes sense. But there's no indication that he received technical training related to IT in the Army, demonstrated by the fact that his post-Army job was as a security guard.<br />
<br />
I mean, look: I worked in software during the dotcom era and I know that in IT you can go quite far without formal education. But the ability to do this was, and still is, and more so now, directly proportional to how unconventional the company/industry you're working in. Government is deeply conservative about this stuff, they're all about credentials. If he'd actually been in Special Forces and also had some relevant specialized training, then maybe he'd get a job with the CIA. I mean, maybe. More likely with a contractor, but just possibly with the CIA. But with no training and no relevant and noteworthy military experience? I don't see that. Working as a security guard, you don't walk into the CIA with just a GED and say, hey, I have mad skillz with computers.<br />
<br />
That said, I also have trouble believing that this guy's story <em>isn't</em> true. Greenwald and others surely did a lot of due diligence and, regardless, the guy had access to stuff that is real.<br />
<br />
So I'm thinking one of two things, perhaps a combination. First, that there's a lot in his history that he's leaving out or that maybe his history isn't what he claims it is. Maybe what he did in the Army is much different than he describes, maybe he actually got a lot of technical training and then did a bunch of intelligence-related IT work that he can't talk about for whatever reasons. Second, maybe his actual responsibilities at CIA and NSA were at a much lower level than he's presenting, although he still had a lot of access as an unavoidable consequence. I dunno.<br />
<br />
Or, maybe, it's just a fluke. Maybe he is really smart and somehow he had a contact or otherwise impressed someone enough that he got someone to hire him at the CIA with basically no qualifications.

<blockquote>Even though I’m tentatively willing to accept Snowden’s claim that he is doing this only because he thinks it’s right, he still seems to be hoping to evade the criminal consequences by defecting to China, a key US rival and one that comes up rather short of being the kind of libertarian and transparent society Snowden apparently believes in.<br />
<br />
Look, I get it. He doesn’t want to go to prison. I don’t blame him. He says in the article that his highest hope is get asylum in Iceland. I can pretty much guarantee you that that’s not going to happen. A small country that wants to be close friends of the United States is not going to do that. I could see arguments for Russia or Venezuela or perhaps Iran. But of all the places where you might have a shot at not getting extradited, China’s not a bad choice. Hong Kong might even give you the best of both worlds, hosted by repressive government which is a US rival and yet living in a city with Western standards of openness, wealth, etc.<br />
<br />
But the decision to go to China inevitably colors his decision and sets up what could be a very uncomfortable diplomatic stand-off. I’ve seen people linking to the current US-Hong Kong extradition treaty. Call me naive but I think this is going to come down to how Beijing wants to play this. If they don’t want a fight over this, Snowden’s toast. If they like the optics of it, I don’t think it matters what that extradition treaty says. China’s a big enough player and the US has enough other fish to fry with the Chinese, that the US is not going to put the bilateral relationship on the line over this guy. And the Chinese might relish granting asylum to an American running from the claws of US ‘state repression’.</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/100776" target="_self">zombieflanders</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5025749" target="_self">3:13 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5025749" style="font-weight:normal;" title="4 users marked this as favorite">4 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

In such conditions we lose interest in the future of our descendents...and meekly allow ourselves to be led in ignorance by a despotic force all the more powerful because it does not resemble one.[15] Tocqueville worried that if despotism were to take root in a modern democracy, it would be a much more dangerous version than the oppression under the Roman emperors or tyrants of the past who could only exert a pernicious influence on a small group of people at a time. In contrast, a despotism under a democracy could see &quot;a multitude of men&quot;, uniformly alike, equal, &quot;constantly circling for petty pleasures&quot;, unaware of fellow citizens, and subject to the will of a powerful state which exerted an &quot;immense protective power&quot;.[3] Tocqueville compared a potentially despotic democratic government to a protective parent who wants to keep its citizens (children) as &quot;perpetual children&quot;, and which doesn't break men's wills but rather guides it, and presides over people in the same way as a shepherd looking after a &quot;flock of timid animals&quot;.[3].

Keep in mind this whole story from the beginning is almost exclusively due to Glenn Greenwald, a columnist for the Guardian who has been a lonely voice (shrill, some say) on government civil rights violations for years.  Snowden likely reached out to Greenwald because of his reputation, much like Manning reached out to Assange.  Greenwald is only partly supported by the Guardian.

This is the biggest problem I have. I don't deny that the intelligence agencies in the United States may in fact be violating privacy rights far more than we think. But it's an unfounded leap to go from: &quot;This is a massive infringement upon our privacy for the sake of security,&quot; to &quot;This is a massive infringement upon our privacy for nefarious purposes of controlling the populous.&quot;<br />
<br />
A major post on Reddit that made /r/bestof was essentially this. The post author wrote that he lives in an effective dictatorship where the government uses intelligence in order to blackmail and oppress political opponents. Sure, intelligence can be used to this end, but on what evidence do we have that the United States government is using it to this purpose?<br />
<br />
We don't have a secret police, a la Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, whereby intelligence is used in this manner.<br />
<br />
I don't think we should be against privacy infringement because of its potential abuse. There are many government mechanisms which we retain despite that they may be potentially abused because they have many beneficial functions. Intelligence gathering has beneficial functions. It's up to us to figure the length to which privacy has been infringed, laws have been violated, and how we want to balance security and privacy.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/104829" target="_self">SollosQ</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5025795" target="_self">3:50 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5025795" style="font-weight:normal;" title="4 users marked this as favorite">4 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

I do wonder about his line of thought.

He specifically addressed this point (and I think very well) in his interview.  When you build a technological mechanism which can be used to impose a tyranny and the only barrier to that tyranny is <i>policy</i> rather than law, it is practically inevitable that someone will find reason to change that policy in the future.  He calls it &quot;turnkey tyranny&quot;.<br />
<br />
The issue isn't that the USA is <i>currently</i> using this system for draconian purposes upon its own populace, it's that it claims the legal right to make such a system and the only thing between us and that tyranny is the <i>goodwill of the government</i>.<br />

<br />
<strong>Which is why I said</strong>, let's not argue against these actions because of something irrelevant as &quot;Oh, this has the potential for abuse.&quot; Let's instead address whether or not this is legal.<br />
<br />
<em>If you have friends who grew up in nations where the secret police had this level of power, you will appreciate how precious it is to feel secure in your privacy.</em><br />
<br />
On a slightly (un)related note, through studying Russian at university, I've met a lot of people who lived in the Soviet Union. And though this effect wasn't really a result from privacy infringement, they were much more mellow about such violations given how safe they (in this case, women) were. They could do something as simple as walk around at night without having to worry for their safety. I also have a family member who lived her whole life in Nazi Germany and has opinions on the matter of what it means to be safe or not, and the opinions she has about this matter aren't going to be what you want me to get from her.<br />
<br />
<em>Saying that we don't need to oppose privacy infringement because we're Americans and things like that can't happen here is like saying that we don't need unions because our bosses aren't the greedy robber-barons of yore.</em> <br />
<br />
There is substantial empirical evidence to suggest that unions are necessary in order to act as a check and balance on greedy bosses. A more proper analogy of what I'm reading here would be to say that we shouldn't have unions because union leaders might get in bed with bosses.<br />
<br />
For instance, there are already checks and balances with the intelligence communities. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The reason that U.S. citizens are left out of this conversation is because of the classified nature of everything. When Nixon actually did stuff that would fit a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, he had to resign or face impeachment due to checks and balances. What is being suggested here, is that the judicial, executive, and legislative branches have the potential to all get in bed (Republicans and Democrats alike) with each other, and the intelligence agencies, in order to oppress and control its populous without any empirical evidence.<br />
<br />
I've never said this couldn't happen in the United States. But I do think that either there'd be signs that such things were happening, and that there's no reason to then reject these measures FOR THE PARTICULAR REASON of potential abuse, because there are other valid arguments to give. OR, even if it'd be possible that there wouldn't be any signs, we're talking about so remote of a possibility, that it's laughable to give as an argument because it's such a slippery slope or &quot;the sky is falling&quot; belief.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/104829" target="_self">SollosQ</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5025828" target="_self">4:12 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5025828" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Iran is building nuclear power facilities. There is potential for abuse simply because they have the capability given nuclear power facilities, but there's no evidence to suggest that their intentions are so, so let's not bother them with all this cyber-war. <br />

Police forces and the military in the United States have a rather one-sided ownership of physical control over U.S. citizens. Citizens can't really stand to wage war against these two forces.

&quot;Shortly after [FBI] Director Hoover’s press conference in November 1964, in which he referred to Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] as the country’s “most notorious liar,” a package was mailed to Dr. King. It contained an anonymous diatribe against the civil rights leader and a copy of an electronic surveillance tape, apparently to lend credence to threats of exposure of derogatory personal information made in the letter. The committee was unable to locate the original letter, but an apparently authentic copy was found in the files of Assistant Director Sullivan. The final paragraph clearly implied that suicide would be a suitable course of action for Dr. King&quot; <br />

<a name="5025848"></a><div class="comments">There's something else that's exhilarating about this is that this whole saga, from the first leak to this interview, where it's all been driven by the raw, crackling power of journalism. The Guardian here has been just astounding in making sure that this story had the maximum impact possible and in providing scoop after scoop to literally make some of the most powerful people in the world tremble and (hey we can dream) potentially change our democracies for the better.<br />
<br />
But there's another side to this that makes me worried and that's little thing that's popped up in a corner of East London: <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/stuff/2013/05/30/guardian-announces-launch-guardiancoffee-shoreditch">#Guardiancoffee</a>. Yes, the Guardian have opened up a cafe in a trendy corner of London as a pop-up store* that's mainly there to be tweeted about. I've been there myself and it's as irritating as it sounds, something that's been agreed to by a committee of out-of-touch, more than slightly desperate managers. <br />
<br />
I'm not mentioning this to cheapen the Guardian in the slightest, but it really highlights to me how damn uncertain the future of journalism is. Here is a newspaper in full command of its powers having to resort to gimmicks to find ways to survive. And these gimmicks aren't working. I don't want to rehash the future of journalism debate that we're all more than familiar with, but christ is this a stark contrast with the Guardian launching in the same month this milestone and this... coffee shop. <br />
<br />
I say this as someone who's been often tempted by journalism but stayed away because I don't know if I can commit to something that's got such a fragile future: I hope similar stories will be managed and released with as much skill in 20 years time. <br />

I don't know if they got search warrants or not to record private conversations of King's, but regardless of what they did, it was an abuse of their powers. Is anyone suggesting that we dismember the FBI's ability to record conversations even with a search warrant? No. We accept that abuses can happen, but that we should implement checks and balances as much as possible to minimize these chances. So why is the NSA's work here any different?

It seems to me that the NSA's work also requires much more checks and balances than the relatively autonomous FBI, which did its work in conjunction with only the DOJ as the article seems to suggest.

From what I heard, the Guardian has signed a 6-month lease on its unit, and the plan is not so much to find alternative revenue streams or promote the newspaper but to use the café environment as a user testing lab for new approaches to content delivery (a problem they're going to have to crack sooner rather than later). (They have iPads bolted to the tables, running the Guardian's news app; it is not certain whether they're running the public build of the app, a new experimental version or a mix.)  When I went there, a journalist there said it was an extension of the Open Weekend the Guardian had last year.<br />

I'm guessing that renting some retail units in Shoreditch and getting a decent local café to provide the coffee (which comes from Nude Espresso, one of London's better roasteries) is a good approach to getting people to show up to your user acceptance lab without them necessarily being the sorts of people who'd trek out to a newspaper's office.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/16782" target="_self">acb</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5025861" target="_self">4:42 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5025861" style="font-weight:normal;" title="3 users marked this as favorite">3 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

You're mixing things up. &quot;Who cares if it can be abused&quot; isn't my reaction to what the government is doing - as if my response of &quot;Who cares if it can be abused&quot; is the response I give in order to display why I am not against what the government is doing. &quot;Who cares if it can be abused&quot; is my reaction to people who say we shouldn't have this capability because it can be abused.<br />

<a name="5025950"></a><div class="comments"><em>Q: But isn't there a need for surveillance to try to reduce the chances of terrorist attacks such as Boston?<br />
<br />
A: &quot;We have to decide why terrorism is a new threat. There has always been terrorism. Boston was a criminal act. It was not about surveillance but good, old-fashioned police work. The police are very good at what they do.&quot;</em><br />
<br />
This. The Bush administration made the wrong call when on Sept. 12, 2001 they declared a &quot;war&quot; on terrorism. In wars, both sides have soldiers, and there are rules, even if they are often ignored. The soldiers of one side have respect for the soldiers on the other side, which they show, for example, by treating prisoners humanely. To declare war on terrorism means that we dignify the terrorists as soldiers, which they are not. They are simply criminals. Bin Laden was a criminal, and so was every accomplice he managed to enlist. <br />
<br />
The Obama administration, while generally backing away from &quot;war on terror&quot; terminology, has nevertheless continued the same policies. What they should have done but didn't is to explicitly label terrorists as criminals and nothing but criminals, and to explicitly describe what they were doing as an international police action to capture or neutralize various identifiable gangs of criminals. They could have done that, and 99 percent of the governments around the world would happily have endorsed that cause and cooperated. Opportunity lost. (<a href="http://www.metafilter.com/55325/All-Quiet-on-the-Terror-Front#1455434">Suggested here in 2006.</a>)<br />
<br />
And now we see the consequences of the failure to distinguish between fighting a war and fighting crime. Because as long as you think in terms of wars and enemies, you will be willing to bend the principles of democracy. Some of our greatest presidents have yielded to this temptation. John Adams did it during the &quot;Quasi War&quot; with France by signing the Alien &amp; Sedition Acts. Lincoln did it in the Civil War by suspending habeus corpus and declaring marial law, among other things. Wilson did in it WWI through over-zealous enforcement of the Espionage Act (jailing socialists simply for criticizing the government, for example). Roosevelt did it in World War II with &quot;internment camps&quot; for Japanese-Americans. Nixon (not among the above-mentioned greatest) did it during the Vietnam War through a wide variety of dirty tricks including the &quot;enemies list&quot; and the Watergate break-in.<br />
<br />
So Obama's role in current data-mining operation has a long list of precedents — all of them justified, at the time, by wartime expediency. Taking &quot;war&quot; out of the equation, and focusing on simple pursuit of criminals, makes it a lot harder to justify. There has always been terrorism. There has always been crime. Terrorism is crime. Not war. Fight terrorism as you would crime.

<blockquote>Of all the dangerous government surveillance powers that were expanded by the USA PATRIOT Act the National Security Letter (NSL) power under 18 U.S.C. § 2709 as expanded by PATRIOT Section 505 is one of the most frightening and invasive. These letters served on communications service providers like phone companies and ISPs allow the FBI to secretly demand data about ordinary American citizens' private communications and Internet activity without any meaningful oversight or prior judicial review. Recipients of NSLs are subject to a gag order that forbids them from ever revealing the letters' existence to their coworkers to their friends or even to their family members much less the public.<br />
<br />
The FBI's systemic abuse of this power has been documented both by a Department Of Justice investigation and in documents obtained by EFF through a Freedom of Information Act request.<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
In 2007 EFF filed Freedom of Information Act litigation seeking documentation of National Security Letter misuse by the FBI. <strong>Thousands of pages of documents were released over a period of four years leading to repeated revealations of government abuses of power.</strong> An EFF report based on these documents led to tough questions for the FBI before Congress. The documents also helped prompt the Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate whether Attorney General Alberto Gonzales lied to Congress.

“Muriel,” she said, “read me the Fourth Commandment. Does it not say something about never sleeping in a bed?”<br />
<br />
With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out.<br />
<br />
“It says, ‘No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets,”’ she announced finally.<br />

Curiously enough, Clover had not remembered that the Fourth Commandment mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so. And Squealer, who happened to be passing at this moment, attended by two or three dogs, was able to put the whole matter in its proper perspective.<br />

“You have heard then, comrades,” he said, “that we pigs now sleep in the beds of the farmhouse? And why not? You did not suppose, surely, that there was ever a ruling against beds? A bed merely means a place to sleep in. A pile of straw in a stall is a bed, properly regarded. The rule was against sheets, which are a human invention. We have removed the sheets from the farmhouse beds, and sleep between blankets. And very comfortable beds they are too! But not more comfortable than we need, I can tell you, comrades, with all the brainwork we have to do nowadays. You would not rob us of our repose, would you, comrades? You would not have us too tired to carry out our duties? Surely none of you wishes to see Jones back?”<br />

The animals reassured him on this point immediately, and no more was said about the pigs sleeping in the farmhouse beds.

I will reword this to be utterly clear. Do you disagree with the view that something can be an infringement of human rights even when not covered by the legal rights granted by the local jurisdiction? For an example, I'll offer you the example of someone shot by a private military contractor without cause in a legal jurisdiction that has exempted those contractors from law (protip: this happened a lot under the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq).<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/37601" target="_self">jaduncan</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5026076" target="_self">6:56 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 </span></div><br><br>

<a name="5026103"></a><div class="comments">I said: &quot;Why don't we instead and stick with concrete things <strong><em>like</em></strong> saying whether or not the government has the legal authority to do x, y, or z?&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't say legality was the only measure we had. If you haven't noticed, <strong><em>no one</em></strong> has told me what it means for something to be authoritarian or totalitarian. Wikipedia gives me a definition of a &quot;secret police&quot; as operating, &quot;to protect the political power of an individual dictator or an authoritarian political regime.&quot; This is a working definition I've been going off of as for what a totalitarian or authoritarian act is.<br />
<br />
I don't see the difference between taxation and surveillance on this consideration, because neither, in and of itself, is done for the purpose of protecting Obama's Dictatorship. <br />
<br />
However, there are other considerations. The constitution for one, what forms of surveillance does it permit? There are ethics for another consideration. There is also democratic concerns, what are the opinions of the American people?<br />
<br />
We can have these discussions, and quite fruitful ones without having to resort to these empty characterizations. Like I've said before, I am only unconditionally against certain forms of argument, such as arguments which make analogy to the Gestapo and other secret police because I don't find these substantive at all.<br />
<br />
I know absolutely nothing about law, so I don't know if these actions are legal or not. Partly because empirically, I don't even know what actions are being considered any more since different sources are saying different things. But if you want to say that certain actions are illegal, then that's perfectly fine. If you want to say that certain actions violate expectations we have for privacy, then that's perfectly fine.<br />
<br />
Personally? I'm largely okay with what's going on so far. Excepting a few Congressmen, members of Congress and the other branches of government seem okay with it. I was watching PBS NewsHour recently, and apparently a poll said a little above 60% of Americans were okay with this reveal. I personally know a lot of individuals in the NSA and CIA, and they are by far, some of the most idealistic people I have met in my life. <br />
<br />
But you know what? I know that many other people feel incredibly violated by this news reveal. I can't understand those feelings of violation for whatever reason, but that's okay. This is a democratic society. I'd like for us to discuss the balance between security and privacy, and to discuss the legality of these things. I just don't feel there's any substantive reason for slippery slope arguments, or meaningless predication.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/104829" target="_self">SollosQ</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5026103" target="_self">7:07 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5026103" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br />
I guess what Greenwald has been arguing for years is that the level of secrecy has reached a point where it is now impossible to oversee or check the actions of this apparatus. Hence the whistleblowers. FISA is operated in secret through the Justice Department. The Senate Intelligence Committee operates within Congress, and then we have the POTUS. All of these parts must have approved of these new surveillance programs. There is a distinction that could be made, I think, between informing the citizens in broad strokes about what kind of surveillance programs exist so we can check their constitutionality, and keeping secret the specific information collected by such a program. But what the government is telling us is that we should not even be privy to the broad strokes. If that is the case, we only have trust and faith and I just don't see how that can work.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/76075" target="_self">Seymour Zamboni</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5026104" target="_self">7:07 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5026104" style="font-weight:normal;" title="8 users marked this as favorite">8 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<a name="5026150"></a><div class="comments">I feel that the NSA, Homeland Security, and other agencies put in charge of keeping us &quot;safe&quot; are likely not trying to become tyrannical.   They're following the directives and ideas they've been given.  They have built amongst themselves a culture that frames the idea of national security as being based on information (and rightfully so, information and security go hand in hand).  I'm sure most employees working for these agencies honestly feel what they're doing is in the nation's best interest (except people like Snowden of course, who found the larger scope of what he saw very unsettling).  The problem is that so many in the NSA do not realize that they are losing sight of what they're protecting.   It's not just people's lives or the health of our economy, which is what the argument has boiled down to.  It's rather about the principles, ethics, and centuries of philosophy that defined this country in the first place.   By sacrificing those ideals just to get a better hand at immediate security threats, they have inadvertently set out to define what those lives are and what they mean, rather than giving us, the people, the opportunity to define ourselves.   That's what's scary about all of this to me.  We may have ended up safer....but have become much less free to make mistakes, learn from them, and redefine ourselves.  At its worst, we're becoming the kind of nation our forefathers once stood against.<br />
<br />
I think that we're in this helpless predicament as common civilians in so many areas not because there are inherently evil individuals pulling the strings at trying to enslave us, but because the idea is ingrained in the minds of these kinds of powerful organizations that they are genuinely being helpful, and that there is no limits on finding shortcuts to increased productivity...the idea of expedited success outweighs the ultimate reality of its consequences....and our laws and prosecutorial powers are not strong enough to hold them back, or even accountable when those ideas start violating the constitution, harming people or the environment.  We've created organizations and corporations (let's face it now, corporations have become government) that are too big to fail, to important to fail, and too protected to jail. That mindset is happening on so many levels within this nation, not just the NSA, and in so many areas, it is up us to pressure congress like we've never pressured them before to stop it..including the shady deals within congress itself...insider stock trading, accepting gifts, decommission of the ethics committee.  Snowden can yell all he wants into the crowd and tell us the emperor has no clothes, but it does no good for any of us if we ignore him and start pretending nothing is wrong again in fear of upsetting the status quo.<br />
<br />
<i>Can you imagine what would happen if he had terminated some secret spying program and then some significant terrorism event occurred? There's no doubt in my mind that someone in Congress would have squawked and impeachment could even be a possibility.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
Politicians will always find an angle that helps them complain about ideas or people they oppose or don't like.  Take the old fable about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller,_his_son_and_the_donkey">the miller, his son, and the donkey</a> for example, which is pretty much summed up in <a href="http://img1.nairaland.com/attachments/718400_AuUw565CAAAoWEb_jpg122f98d2f68f43c1ebe254dd3e8df073">this cartoon</a>.  Criticizing and finding fault in one's actions or inactions is easy to do, as you can find fault in *anything* given the right narrative for context, even if it means making something up that is hard to defend against.<br />
<br />
Frustrating isn't it?  The political problem here is there's no ideal answer for the politician who is focused on the success of their career.  The national problem is there seems to be no absolute answer than ensures the safety of Americans, while preserving freedoms. Even with all of these intelligence gathering practices, we still see domestic terrorism every day in the form of lunatics with a chip on their shoulder and a gun in their hands.  We've lost the equivalent of several 9/11's to this kind of insanity, with not much to show for it as it hasn't perceivably affected our economy or &quot;big business&quot; in such a way to get our government's resources re-allocated to address it.  We just pay their salaries, that's all we're good for right?<br />
<br />
Decentralized and loosely audited leadership within this country along with agencies and individuals that have found ways to exempt themselves from constitutional law have brought us to where we are today...moreso the interpretation of our country's founding principles by various organizations including, but not limited to, the POTUS himself.  Obama is not ultimately to blame here, but does play a vital role that could help further provide context and direction on this discussion in ways the average you and I cannot...which is disconcerting given the fact we should be able to then *also* vote on these things, as &quot;misguided&quot; and uninformed as we currently are.   But I don't think we're directly in danger of tyranny.  The moment we are complacent is the moment we've lost this country...and honestly I still feel we're a long ways off, but are also set behind considerably and have a lot of work to do.  Declassifying NSA's operations (not content) may be a good place to start.  Next up, the out-right scam surrounding Monsanto.  Perhaps Congress and their shady practices need to be focused on as well.  Be relentless folks, it's still our country.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/3202" target="_self">samsara</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5026150" target="_self">7:23 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5026150" style="font-weight:normal;" title="10 users marked this as favorite">10 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Since you're apparently serious, here:<br />

Tax laws are written transparently by elected representatives, and can be changed through the democratic process.<br />
<br />
NSA officials warrantlessly trawling through your online communications is neither transparent, nor conducted by elected officials, and operates outside of the realm of the democratic process.<br />

<br />
OK, I'll have a shot at this. It is authoritarian when the state does something that infringes the freedoms of all to prevent against a comparatively small threat. An example of this would be the action of surveilling all communication to protect against comparatively small risks such as terrorism. The infringements of human rights are not proportionate to the risk, even if we don't take the view of the constitution that some rights should never be infringed. I'll also note that the state secret doctrine means it is now very hard to get the judicial system to even comment on intelligence matters.<br />
<br />
Right now you are living in a state and time where emailing the wrong people can very easily get you on the no-fly list at the least, torture is admitted to have happened, and human rights are often infringed in detention of political dissidents (see Black Panthers detained in the 60s but still in solitary now, for example). The root issue is more the increasingly unchecked power of the executive in terrorism and law enforcement stuff in general. The US executive is becoming powerful at a much faster rate than the oversight and regulation designed to check the actions of that executive, and enforcement of law is easy against political protesters and hard against LEOs. Historically, comparatively unchecked executive powers have not led to good things, especially when combined with impunity for admitted past offences.<br />
<br />
Given that, it seems a poor idea to also give the state a huge amount of information to use against political opponents based only on a relatively low claimed threat.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/37601" target="_self">jaduncan</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5026214" target="_self">7:43 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5026214" style="font-weight:normal;" title="4 users marked this as favorite">4 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Quite a hard problem, but just go with the 80/20 rule, declassify 80%. It's probably more like 95 percent before we get to any information that would be a danger, but clearly most of that declassified material would be embarrassing. <br />

Not going to happen as that embarrassment will go a long way towards vast numbers of formerly essential folks loosing their funding.

<blockquote>Plans for the &quot;secret room&quot; [In San Francisco the &quot;secret room&quot; is Room 641A at 611 Folsom Street] were fully drawn up by <strong>December 2002</strong>, curiously only four months after Darpa started awarding contracts for TIA. One 60-page document, identified as coming from &quot;AT&amp;T Labs Connectivity &amp; Net Services&quot; and authored by the labs' consultant Mathew F. Casamassima, is titled Study Group 3, LGX/Splitter Wiring, San Francisco and dated 12/10/02. This document addresses the special problem of trying to spy on fiber-optic circuits. Unlike copper wire circuits which emit electromagnetic fields that can be tapped into without disturbing the circuits, fiber-optic circuits do not &quot;leak&quot; their light signals. In order to monitor such communications, one has to physically cut into the fiber somehow and divert a portion of the light signal to see the information.

Obamacare is not going to stop medical bankruptcy in the US. It's certainly an improvement but it's not going to 'solve the problem'.  It will likely get replaced with something else (like Medicare for all) in the future 
<blockquote><i>Obama's problem was in not curbing this expansion and keeping the practice relatively opaque. He chose to focus his attention on healthcare reform and renewable energy</i></blockquote>

Are you actually out of your mind?  The first thing he did after health care passed was expand offshore drilling. During the campaign he criticized Romney for being insufficiently pro-coal. There has been some <i>minor</i> investment in renewable energy, but not nearly enough and hardly any attempts to curtail fossil fuel use at all.  (We have seen some CO2 emission reduction, but a large part of that is switching from coal to natural gas.) <br />
<br />
What he seems to have spent most of his time on after healthcare was &quot;the deficit&quot; and trying to cut social security for no reason, which is why we got the insane sequester, etc.

Yeah, you think the extradition treaty, signed <b>when HK was a part of the British empire</b> is going worth the paper it's printed on for this guy? As far as the Chinese our concerned granting him asylum would be a PR and Intel bonanza. They'd get to claim that we're &quot;just as bad&quot; as them, get us back for helping that one dude, and of course lots of info about US Intel operations in China. <br />
<br />
The US couldn't even get Roman Polanski when he traveled to a country with a US extradition treaty. 
<blockquote><i>I completely understand why he went to Hong Kong. But if it was civil disobedience he was interested in going there was a grave mistake. It's going to be way too easy to paint this as some sort of Chinese influence.</i></blockquote>

That's not going to change the facts of the leak, though. 
<blockquote><i>Totally agree. But the Icelandic public has a great deal of sympathy for whistle-blowers, and the dialogue right now is one of &quot;sure, let him stay here&quot;.

<br />
Honestly, depending on how the PRC feels, China would be much safer for him then Iceland.  Iceland has only 300k people in the entire country. The US could easily fly in a couple helicopters, pick him up and leave.  They wouldn't be able to protect him at all. If the PRC wants to turn him over for some reason, of course, then he's screwed. 
<blockquote><i>The same United States that overthrew the democratically elected leader of Iran? The same one that sold missiles to the Ayatollah? The United States that had has a network of secret prisons and torture centers throughout the world? Are you kidding? This United States will, without concern, cause massive civilian harm to advance what it thinks are in its own interest, and has proven so again and again. And saying this simple truth makes someone a nut? I think not.</i></blockquote>

What would be the point of killing this guy now? If he were to travel to Iceland, the US government could simply wait for him to get there, then as I said fly in some helicopters and pick him up. What exactly is Iceland do about it, write an angry letter? <br />

Well that remained to be seen until people actually told me what they meant by it.

I think what's bothering everyone&mdash;well, Obama voters anyway&mdash;is that it was assumed that the worst of these practices, including the pants-shittingly terrifying Total Information Awareness program of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office">Information Awareness Office</a>, had been somewhat curtailed under the current administration.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/76412" target="_self">ob1quixote</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5026380" target="_self">8:32 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5026380" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<blockquote><i><sub>Even as the larger computer makers sold their systems to the government and start-ups of all sorts trafficked in personal information, the companies tried to keep clear of government rules that might cramp their vision ...<br />
<br />
 In 1999, Scott McNealy, the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, summed up the valley’s attitude toward personal data in what became a defining comment of the dot-com boom. “You have zero privacy,” he said. “Get over it.”<br />
<br />
Mr. McNealy is not retracting that comment, not quite; but like Mr. Metcalfe he is more worried about potential government abuse than he used to be. “Should you be afraid if AT&amp;T has your data? Google?” he asked. “They’re private entities. AT&amp;T can’t hurt me. Jerry Brown and Barack Obama can.” An outspoken critic of the California state government, and Mr. Brown, the governor, Mr. McNealy said his taxes are audited every year. </sub></i></blockquote> 
<blockquote><i>Well that remained to be seen until people actually told me what they meant by it. </i></blockquote>

Even without the NSA, way too much personal information is being collected and used as a commodity. <br />
<br />
Try a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/totalitarian">dictionary maybe</a>?  The definition is the government having complete control, particularly &quot;socially, financially and politically&quot;. <br />
<br />
A system like this would <b>easily allow</b> that to occur.  With this system in place the government could monitor every business and easily interfere with ones it didn't like, it could easily monitor the formation of political movements and shut them down. It would know everything about everyone's social life. Certainly, they could chose not to do it, but that would be a choice they would have to actively make every day. <br />
<br />
Like he said, the system is &quot;turnkey totalitarianism&quot;.  Once it's in place a government simply needs to &quot;turn the key&quot; to go from trying to control &quot;terrorists&quot; to anyone they don't like <br />

There is no perfect result here. But I think it is fair for the broad parameters of proposed surveillance programs to be vetted publicly before congress while the specific data collected by publicly approved programs remain secret. The NSA might claim that even making the broad parameters public will compromise the program. Well, that is a risk we will have to take. What we can't have is broad surveillance programs proposed, approved, and deployed in secret. That is untenable because we would have to rely strictly on faith and trust that laws are not broken.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/76075" target="_self">Seymour Zamboni</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5026392" target="_self">8:38 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 </span></div><br><br>

Of course. Life for loyalists, or those who can feign loyalism – when there's a difference between the two – is more or less fine no matter the government.

I chose him, and I'm not going to back down from that. <br />

Politics is complicated, and there's lots of reasons to vote for, and even support, a president.

<br />
A &quot;turnkey&quot; was once an official entrusted with the keys of a prison, someone who was on the very lowest rank of prison management. It then became a derogatory term for someone with enough officious power to make people's lives unpleasant, but not enough to earn them any respect. The  article you <a href="http://brianstorms.com/2013/06/snowden-and-turnkey-tyranny-a-reference-to-an-1819-political-article.html">link</a> to uses it in its literal sense: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Carlile#Peterloo_and_The_Republican">Richard Carlile</a> was imprisoned, which meant that even junior prison authorities (turnkeys) had absolute (tyrannical) authority over him.<br />
<br />
I think Snowden meant to use the phrase in its modern meaning: a turnkey system is one that is supplied in such a state that it can be easily activated by someone without much experience. I suppose that this meaning comes from the old use of &quot;turnkey&quot; to mean &quot;a junior official with very constrained power and authority&quot;, combined with the idea that a complex machine might be activated by simply turning a key. In consequence, &quot;turnkey tyranny&quot; is tyranny that may be imposed at any time using processes that have been established earlier.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/40518" target="_self">Joe in Australia</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5026480" target="_self">10:14 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5026480" style="font-weight:normal;" title="10 users marked this as favorite">10 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

We might see stagnation in real wages broadly across society, and a corresponding fall in standard of living for the majority, but when you're not part of that majority, it's probably pretty easy to believe you're fighting the good fight.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/59894" target="_self">anonymisc</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5026519" target="_self">11:11 PM</a>  on June 9, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5026519" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

As I understand this, the main problem with this is that it wasn't entirely clear that the NSA had these powers available to them. David Simon<a href="http://davidsimon.com/we-are-shocked-shocked/"> wrote an article</a> about this where his argument was that this is essentially a scaled up version of what the police do to investigate gangs in cities. The difference being here that A-scaling something up can make it much worse and B-The scrutiny available her is very not transparent.<br />

I think the lack of oversight really does matter.

Data mining by IT geeks. yippee. Just jump from bubble to bubble, pick up a bucket of money here, a bucket there. What could go wrong? Here, let me forward you these cute cat pictures, along with all the email headers of the last nine contacts who got a look at them. Somewhere in there is Kevin Bacon's email addy. And, yeah, here's my contact list, my friend list. Whoopie. Now I can email my friend in Japan and show him my photo album. I will teach the world to sing, in perfect harmony....no, that was Coke, and the revolution died with Jimi. Shit, that Hearts and Minds thing fell apart quick, eh? Pressing on....Ah preemptive war, gunboat democracy, and we will get them bastards civilized and enlightened if we have to starve them all. Rambo, Arnie, and all those killing killing games...no, no, there's no relationship between violent video games and what happens in the real world. Okay, there are the drones, but that's sort of a coincidence, yeah?<br />
<br />
Spying by the government. Ah jeez. I sure didn't see that coming. They know where I live and how much I spend and where and who's on my email list...(I'm not sure it's fair to assume the government is the entity that's in charge here). If you don't worry about the gun registration, what the fuck do you care about them knowing where you bought your shoes? The issue is control, as I see it, and it seems clear that the government isn't in control. We may be about to redefine the word &quot;amok.&quot; In the meantime, a best-case-scenario would be if nobody is in charge. Otherwise it's some prick like Cheney, or Murdock. Or any of those unmentionable neo's that got voted out in the 90's.<br />

I'm sure there are plenty of posters ready to jump on me for this, but could Ellsberg possibly be more histrionic here? This looks really bad, and it could very well be the most important leak in history. <br />

So far, we've seen a few (admittedly very damning) documents that have already been misinterpreted to some degree (see the ZDNet link above). We don't really know what the story is yet. And everything we know has come from sources (Greenwald, Snowden) that appear to be pretty ideologically motivated. <br />

Me? I think I can be unequivocal in my thinking that it's a massive leak.

That's a great quote. Very helpful. It says that this person is more than happy to lie, because that statement can never be true. And as this person is the director of the NSA, it also says that the NSA itself is more than happy to lie, at any time, and about anything, and to even make statements that are false on their face. <br />
<br />
It is just as if NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander, interviewed in the heartland of America -- let's say Ottumwa, IA (Yes sir? RADAR!) -- said definitively, convincingly and on-the-record in the midst of a torrential downpour, &quot;It never rains on the citizens of the United States.&quot;<br />

For someone who's attacking journalists for making errors, he made one himself.  He claimed the guardian article was based on the WaPo article, when in fact they had also been given the slides as well.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, he's claiming that journalism has failed because the WaPo article was edited. In fact, that's pretty standard practice in big news orgs, it's nothing new.  <br />
<br />
Snowden was smart.  He set the two newspapers in competition with each other, as a way of adding pressure on each of them to leak ASAP in order to avoid getting scooped. <br />
<br />
Finally, there's no evidence that the original story was wrong at all, and the slides clearly indicate that the access is 'direct', and the companies must be aware of what's going at least in some way. Telling people that the access was &quot;indirect in some way&quot; and that maybe the companies had never heard the actual <i>name</i> of the program they were involved in doesn't really change any of the relevant facts for people.

All the pentagon papers said was that the Vietnam war had been going badly for a long time and that it was clearly known by the higher-ups. It wasn't anything anyone didn't know. <br />
<br />
Anyway, as a result of this we are either just going to have to accept all our lives and all our data being data mined and analyzed by the government, or put a stop to this.  In the past lots of people thought it might be possible, but it was always just something that could be dismissed as paranoid, not really happening, not something that would ever happen <i>in America</i> (maybe in China or North Korea or something, people might think) <br />
<br />
But now we know it's happening.  So now a choice needs to be made. The way we've been going it seems like the choice is going to be to just let it happen - but and society is going to change from one where people feel free to speak freely and say whatever they want to one where they'll know everything they say online is going to be monitored and analyzed by the government. <br />
<br />
So I don't really see how you can say this leak isn't going to have historical import.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/10539" target="_self">delmoi</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5026776" target="_self">6:42 AM</a>  on June 10, 2013 </span></div><br><br>

Also, what he said made sense, if it's already a situation where the police would use deadly force, say a hostage situation, does it make any practical difference if they use a human sniper or some kind of robot? <br />
<br />
(I would say the difference is in aggregate, just like the difference between having the police poor through phone records by hand, or collecting and analyzing everyone's records automatically - and also police are only supposed to use deadly force to protect lives, which would not be the case if there was only a drone there. So I don't agree with that idea, and Neither does Rand Paul at this point, since he apparently changed his mind after saying that.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/10539" target="_self">delmoi</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5026823" target="_self">7:18 AM</a>  on June 10, 2013 </span></div><br><br>

This guy wasn't even technically part of the NSA, but a contractor with clearances.

Here's the thing, US Citizens aren't the only ones with a stake in this, they make up a minority of the users of these services.   How would Amber feel if all her emails were being read by the Chinese, or Iran, or Vladimir Putin?   <br />
<br />
The people of, for example <i>Hong Kong</i> - which does not have a censored internet would certainly appreciate knowing. <br />
<br />
And actually if you think about, these revelations have actually been a huge gift for the PR gift to the Chinese government either way.  They now get to say that their internet censorship has been <i>protecting</i> their people from being spied on by the US. Imagine if Chinese people were still using google, just imagine what kind of intelligence the US could get just reading their Gmail/Hotmail/Yahoo emails and Facebook messages? Even if people were careful, there would still be a lot of data 'leaking' onto those services by careless people. <br />
<br />
So one of the biggest aspects of this leak is how it actually relates to something that affects <i>billions</i> of people <i>directly</i>. With the Pentagon Papers, and with Bradley Manning it was mostly related to the US (as well as Vietnam/Iraq/Afghanistan) and didn't really relate to something that <i>directly</i> impacted them in their personal lives.  <br />
<br />
With this leak, it's information that directly applies to people's lives around the world, billions of people, no doubt, use these services and now know that the US government has access to all their personal data.

    When a correction is made online, the story editor is responsible for alerting universal, home-page and social teams to make the necessary changes to headlines and blurbs.

The impact of the leak inside the NSA has been enormous. “There is complete freak-out mode at the agency right now,” one former intelligence officer told The Daily Beast. “There has never been anything like this in terms of the speed of referral of a crime report to the Justice Department.

It also calls into question motivation and thus the legitimacy of the documents &quot;leaked&quot;.  What if he fudged some things to make the documents look worse?  What if he stumbled upon someone's wish list of features of PRISM and not operating instructions?  What if he is doing a sort of grand &quot;suicide by cop&quot; kind of thing?  What if the info he found was phony, planted to catch leakers?<br />

If we can ponder whether he isn't real or exactly how the black helicopters will shoot him down on his way to his lair in Iceland, and the (abhorrent) idea that there will be trumped up sexual assault charges, we can speculate about this too.<br />

Any person who has a security clearance needs a trustworthy and easily accessible legal channel for reporting abuse, then. I can't see a way to make any broad classified systems work when the people within keep running up against the problem of finding a safe, trustworthy outlet to report abuses, some sort of watchdog group outside of the circle of individuals already involved in Congress/FISA/the executive that is given enough clout to actually do something with the complaints, and in the absence of that it's no wonder that they turn to reporters and Wikileaks as those outlets tick more boxes than the options provided by government - if not safe, they're at least trustworthy, and public opinion's certainly got clout.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/148542" target="_self">jason_steakums</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5027380" target="_self">11:00 AM</a>  on June 10, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5027380" style="font-weight:normal;" title="6 users marked this as favorite">6 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<a name="5027425"></a><div class="comments">I guess that's my biggest problem with all of this, above and beyond the actual alleged abuses of surveillance powers, because that shit's always going to happen and the best we can hope for is for it to be stamped out and fixed quickly when it does happen - if someone's created a system that's so locked down that leaks to the press are the only way to check it for abuse, they've got no right to complain when that happens. The intelligence community is right to address any factual errors in the leaks, but they're wrong to treat the leak itself as anything other than a natural outcome of the system they built, and if they want to complain that there are factual errors but can't tell you what they are because that's classified, well, there should have been a trustworthy checking system for classified operations that can actually address accusations of abuse while accommodating any necessary secrecy.<br />

The problem is, they make a formal report, and then what?  Does anything actually happen?  Everything that was being done at the NSA was &quot;legal&quot;, reporting through official channels wouldn't have had any effect, since obviously Obama supports the program and says it should continue. <br />

If he'd sat in his cube leaking info he would have been quickly tracked (by the nature of the several documents he had published), and either fed innocuous info and put under surveillance (to see what he was up to), or else captured at once. All classified documents are traceable to their users....wait, that's not quite true. FOUO, Confidential or Secret (non-codeword) documents are sometimes generic in nature, so any of many persons, all working in different areas, might have had access to them. <br />
<br />
The stuff in question here in classified TS/crypto + codeword + codeword (for example a TS ELINT project may have a generic TS codeword, plus another codeword that directs a package to a specific compartmented project. Usually the project names are classified either Secret or TS, and their info carries the codeword designator. Crypto indicates that the info relates to a gathering system). There's no way that this material could<em> not</em> have been traced to him, probably immediately upon its disclosure to the press. I believe he took what he wanted, then fled, knowing there wouldn't be a second bite at this particular apple.<br />
<br />
Still, I completely agree that diligent journalism is our friend here. But we (Americans) may be the Hindenburg and the press may be the breathless reporter. Nothing stops the fire, and it turns out to be set in motion by some goddam act of political hubris.<br />
<br />
Classified info comes in two flavors: ass-covering, and national security. The ass-covering is the least of your worries. National Security is where they decide to nuke the Soviet Union in order to preserve the American Way of life, for an example from my era. You can stick drone warfare and waterboarding into contemporary issues and come out with the same dynamic. The point being that with classified info, there is only the razor's edge to stand on, and the slippery slope theory of morality is a pleasant fiction. If the dictator is benevolent, fine...all you have to worry about is whether they are coming for you or just the Gypsies. If he's Stalin, then you may have other concerns. This is the deep end of the pool: secret stuff. In this case, your nightmares are what<em> they</em> mine for ideas, and it's already too late to vet them for good or bad intentions.<br />
<br />
Histrionics are inevitable: BTW, the damning aspect of the Pentagon Papers for Nixon was the disclosure that he used illegal wiretaps and had his henchmen commit crimes. By the time Ellsberg released those documents, nobody was surprised to hear that the government was less than candid about goings on in Vietnam.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/149961" target="_self">mule98J</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5027475" target="_self">11:39 AM</a>  on June 10, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5027475" style="font-weight:normal;" title="5 users marked this as favorite">5 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

James Fallows made the same point, but in a slightly different context. Systems like these are ripe for abuse, whether by rogue agents spying on their neighbors, or rogue libertarians leaking operational details to the public.<br />

Can you share a little more of your expertise in this area of the law and robust whistleblower programs? Do contractors such as BAH have the same or similar processes? Are private sector processes robust enough to overcome organization-wide incentives not to disclose abuse (ie, preservation of revenue streams)?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/26577" target="_self">notyou</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5027517" target="_self">12:02 PM</a>  on June 10, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5027517" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Well, you sound very credible! 
<blockquote><i> why does one high-school dropout get to decide what gets revealed to the entire world? </i></blockquote> Because he had the data. 
<blockquote><i>Didn't we vote someone in to make these decisions</i></blockquote>

No, we voted for someone who claimed to have the opposite position, who betrayed us.  You don't get to break your campaign promises and then claim a democratic mandate for the opposite.

Just spitballing here, but if you had an oversight committee in Congress made up of those who are <em>not</em> involved with the general oversight of these programs, who can appoint and provide limited intelligence clearance for civilian expert advisors in the relevant technology in each case to make up for Congress' pretty shitty handling and understanding of tech questions, that would at least be a step in the right direction. It's outside the direct structure of the intelligence community, at least.

See, I don't think this is a workable system in this case, because what's your supervisor or the Inspector General going to do when the orders came from above them, and what's Congress going to do when members have already tried and failed to address these concerns?

Right, but the president, the FISA court, etc had signed off on it - so even if you reported it, it wouldn't go anywhere, and would likely hurt your career and furthermore make you an obvious target if it ever leaked. It might be found unconstitutional at the supreme court, at some point in the future but as far as the people in charge, it's &quot;legal&quot; in their minds. <br />

Why are you cheering on the person who is giving you a royal shafting?<br />

The public needs whistleblowers because the government cannot be trusted to keep itself transparent- as these revelations clearly demonstrate. The rationale for the surveillance's legality was so tortured it had to be kept secret because it wouldn't withstand scrutiny.<br />

That's all beside the point that Obama campaigned on a platform that was explicitly against domestic surveillance- and then oversaw the infiltration and surveillance of domestic protest groups, the crackdown on whistleblowers and journalistic freedom, and the murdering of children and American citizens with drone strikes.<br />

<br />
Because the &quot;one high-school dropout&quot; had the documents and a conscience. That's all it takes.<br />
<br />
In some ways, this is how it always worked. We know about FBI harassment of Martin Luther King because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens'_Commission_to_Investigate_the_FBI">activists broke into an FBI field office</a> and mailed documents to newspapers, exposing COINTELPRO abuses and prompting Congressional investigations.<br />
<br />
In other ways, it is now very different -- Senators like Wyden and Udall already knew about abuses, but were legally barred from talking about them. As far as I know, Wyden and Udall <em>are now breaking the law</em> merely by affirming that last weeks revelations were in fact what they had previously alluded to in nebulous terms.<br />
<br />
When the government's interpretation of the law is held secret, its legitimacy is eroded. Which action was worse, the field office break-in, or Snowden's leak?<br />
<br />
<em>As for the formal report, people can get fired or in the case of the waterboarding lady, not get the top job.</em><br />
<br />
These do not really seem like fair outcomes considering the fact that the guy who blew the whistle on the waterboarding program is now incarcerated.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/142099" target="_self">compartment</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5027610" target="_self">12:54 PM</a>  on June 10, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5027610" style="font-weight:normal;" title="11 users marked this as favorite">11 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<a name="5027624"></a><div class="comments">This weekend DNI and former BAH executive James Clapper <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/intel-chief-clapper-gave-least-untruthful-answer-u-164742798.html">explained his &quot;least untruthful&quot;</a> response to Senator Wyden's question last March in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. <br />
<br />
First, the exchange with Wyden:
<blockquote>Wyden: &quot;And this is for you, Director Clapper, again on the surveillance front. And I hope we can do this in just a yes or no answer, because I know Sen. Feinstein wants to move on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last summer the NSA director was at a conference and he was asked a question about the NSA surveillance of Americans. He replied, and I quote here, '... the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is completely false.'<br />
<br />
&quot;The reason I'm asking the question is, having served on the committee now for a dozen years, I don't really know what a dossier is in this context. So what I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question: Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clapper: &quot;No, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyden: &quot;It does not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clapper: &quot;Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect, but not wittingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyden: &quot;All right. Thank you. I'll have additional questions to give you in writing on that point, but I thank you for the answer.&quot;</blockquote>

And here's Clapper's explanation:
<blockquote>On Sunday, NBC News' Andrea Mitchell pressed him on the NSA collection and on the exchange with Wyden.<br />
<br />
Clapper suggested that the senator's question was unfair.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said, I have great respect for Sen. Wyden. I thought, though in retrospect, I was asked [a] 'When are you going to stop beating your wife' kind of question, which is ... not answerable necessarily by a simple yes or no,&quot; Clapper said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I responded in what I thought was the most truthful, or least untruthful, manner by saying 'no,'&quot; Clapper said, indicating that he did not consider it &quot;collection&quot; unless government officials actually reviewed the content of the communications. The NSA program, regarding phone records, scoops up &quot;metadata&quot;—phone numbers called, duration of calls, location and the like.</blockquote>

This would be an example of the forthrightness with which the leaders of the nation's intelligence services respond to lawful, robust oversight?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/26577" target="_self">notyou</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5027624" target="_self">1:08 PM</a>  on June 10, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5027624" style="font-weight:normal;" title="20 users marked this as favorite">20 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br />
Snowden himself certainly seems to think it's a threat...which is why he is where he is.<br />
<br />
<em>Snowden traveled to Hong Kong from Hawaii, where he lived with his girlfriend, right before leaking the documents, choosing the city because &quot;they have a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent.” Still, he’s well aware lots of things could happen to him: The United States could begin extradition proceedings, the Chinese government may try to question him. And he even sees rendition as a possibility. </em><br />
<br />
But sure, ok, the NSA has nothing to do with those.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/18778" target="_self">emjaybee</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5027668" target="_self">1:31 PM</a>  on June 10, 2013 </span></div><br><br> 
<a name="5027671"></a><div class="comments">I've debated posting this because I'm not sure how sensitive the information is, but the person I was talking to said that they were allowed to tell me this, so here goes...<br />
<br />
About a year ago I was talking to an acquaintance who's doing non-IT related work for the building in Utah which is currently being constructed.  He'd been obliquely hinting around to working for the NSA with some sort of clearance and level of secrecy, and so I playfully asked him if he was working on the data warehouse in Utah, not expecting him to say yes, and he looked uncomfortable and then said that he was.  He said that he wasn't allowed to tell me much more than that, and then went on to talk about how the Wired investigative piece from Bamford was full of misinformation due to Bamford having an axe to grind and, &quot;of course the NSA isn't spying on American citizens.&quot;<br />
<br />
He made the distinction that they weren't storing anything at the Utah facility, and that it was for 'processing' only.  I didn't feel like arguing with him, since he has an abrasive personality, and it was something I could see myself getting heated up about (I've long ago decided that having political arguments at parties is a rude thing to do to the inevitable spectators), so I said &quot;Huh, well, there you go,&quot; and let it drop.  However, even at the time it seemed like bullshit.  Why do you need that much room for processing?  <br />
<br />
So if the 'processing' line is something that the NSA was feeding people working for them, then is that just a linguistic dodge?  I mean - you have to store stuff to process it.  It's not like things are going in to RAM and then being deleted forever, right?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/97321" target="_self">codacorolla</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5027671" target="_self">1:31 PM</a>  on June 10, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5027671" style="font-weight:normal;" title="3 users marked this as favorite">3 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Snowden specifically used the word &quot;storing&quot; in describing part of what's going on. And consider the breadth of the surveillance, my guess is that no, data is not being poured through a 16GB Flash drive in a Dell tower somewhere in Utah before immediate deletion.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/71801" target="_self">Marisa Stole the Precious Thing</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5027684" target="_self">1:37 PM</a>  on June 10, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5027684" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Only children refer to adults as &quot;grownups&quot;, and indeed it's a childish trope – the idea that anyone who belives in freedom and privacy and not killing people in wars or whatever other ideals is just a childish naïf, and that only responsible, mature, people unencumbered by any moral sentiment should make decisions. <br />

It's trivial to do, and gives plausible deniability in the process. If I made a program that requests the data on this page, storing the result only as a variable in memory, did whatever processing magic I felt like on that information, kept the processing results and cleared the variable when I was done, I never &quot;stored&quot; the data.

No problem! If that's indeed the kind of thing they're doing, there is still plenty of potential for abuse - in their choice of data sources, the kind of requests they're making from those sources, the &quot;processing magic&quot; step, the possibility of someone intercepting that variable's full contents before it's cleared, the security around the source code and the vetting of that code - I mean, how do non-experts in Congress even ask the right questions there? - etc... tons of potential issues.

<br />
I would much prefer sticking to (a), because there are now people arguing in this thread about where and how the NSA is going to put a black bag on this guy's head. <strong>THAT</strong> is what I was referring to as needless speculation. No one can, in good faith, argue that we ought to be speculating about things that we cannot know, then argue with one another about those things as though our speculation were truth.<br />

<a name="5027847"></a><div class="comments">National Security is where they decide to nuke the Soviet Union in order to preserve the American Way of life, for an example from my era.<br />
<br />
ironmouth: <em>The United States never nuked the Soviet Union.</em><br />
<br />
Hmm. I guess my failure to communicate here resides in my opinion that contingency plans are decisions. Your experience at this NSA stuff ought to have made this clear: the missiles were in the silos, waiting for the decision boxes to line up that would send them on their way over the arctic. But, before we tweaked the guidance on the warheads, though, we had to dig the holes and train the officers who sat at the consoles, and come up with the physical keys and code keys and the security protocols. Before that we had to have the martial effontry to assume that this was the best of the choices available to us, should things go south. The policy, you recall, was Mutual Assured Destruction, and the decision was to put it in place. The decision to nuke the SU was made when those details turned into manned missile silos and B-52s in constant flight worldwide, plus the nuclear subs, global NSA listening posts, CIA and other assets in foreign nations that risked their lives to send out pictures of Back Rests and Fan Songs, so the analysts at Fort Meade could measure the antenna. Also, my area, several dozens of orbiting satellites that imaged or recorded stuff.<br />
<br />
Now, time's passed, the details have changed, and my primitive electronic toys are all outmoded by factors I could barely imagine, but the mentality is the same. The MAD factor existed then, and it's evolved. The NSA is a collector, sure. They don't send out the teams of assassins or any of that shit. They don't parachute into enemy territory. That job is done by other members of the DoD. I am a prisoner of my own experiences: you create tools, and then you use them, is the way it works. I believe it was a fluke of history that the ICBMs weren't exchanged. But that's not really what we have here: now it's computers. A more up-to-date analogy to ICBM threat (as international political capital) resides in cyberspace.<br />
<br />
If you think my example is a stretch, I invite you to consider the two devices we dropped on Japan. That event, though it remains controversial, can be defended, and I can sort of draw some parallels between newly emerging cyberspace presence and atomic weapons: we are threatened, the tool is fairly new, and we don't have much perspective with which to form a context. Hell, we still don't have a working theory about how nuclear weapons will be tolerated, used, or abandoned, we just don't want them to be in the hands of enemies crazy--or desperate--enough to use them. <br />
<br />
I don't mean this as an endorsement of nuclear weapons. I am suggesting that our defense structure is sometimes crazy, but in general it is trying to defend us. This whole topic is laced with hidden arguments, and all the closets are stuffed with elephants and 500lb gorillas.<br />
<br />
Fighting a wars in a just way, or fighting in a just war. Two different things, and they are always doomed to struggle against each other. The boundary is amorphous, and someone will always be dirty. Also, there will be heroes.<br />
<br />
See, this is where you get back to the simple-minded versions of America. Unfortunately we get the options to see shades of grey, so we can be confused, can spend time on what's right and what's wrong. In the defense establishment, fewer shades of grey exist, because that's how the analysis works.<br />
<br />
Snowden ran out of shades of grey, and he made a decision. I'd like to think I would have a similar set of brass balls. It's easy to jump off a chopper on a hot CA and run at the flashing lights. Not too much to decide. It would be harder, though, to lay the rifle down in basic training, and tell them to haul me away because I didn't believe in that stinking war. <br />
<br />
How cool it would be if the moral imperative overtook the establishment this time. Probably won't happen though, for all the reasons we've seen exposed in this thread.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/149961" target="_self">mule98J</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5027847" target="_self">2:45 PM</a>  on June 10, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5027847" style="font-weight:normal;" title="7 users marked this as favorite">7 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

I didn't call you a naïf, I said that was what you were accusing other people of being. I did say that was childish, and it is. 
<blockquote><i> but anti-scientific thinking is going to help no one.</i> -- samofidelis </blockquote>

I don't think you understand how science actually works, you have to be able to do repeatable experiments.  Journalism isn't science, and this can't be studied &quot;scientifically&quot; unless all the details are declassified, and since that isn't going to happen we can only speculate and wait for more leaks from other people with their own agendas.

The thing is, Bush didn't really go after whistle-blowers with nearly the same fervor as Obama has, at least not from what I remember. Thomas Drake whistle-blew in 2005, but wasn't indicted until 2010 when Obama was in charge, although apparently there was an FBI raid in 2007. <br />
<br />
In fact, his wikipedia article has a good example why people might be afraid to use the formal reporting mechanism: 
<blockquote><i>In July 2007, armed FBI agents raided the homes of Roark, Binney, and Wiebe, <b>the same people who had filed the complaint with the DoD Inspector General in 2002.</b>[27] Binney claims they pointed guns at his wife and himself. Wiebe said it reminded him of the Soviet Union.[21] None of these people were charged with any crimes. In November 2007, there was a raid on Drake's residence. </i></blockquote>

So in other words, people who tried to do things the &quot;right&quot; way ended up being persecuted when the program went public. Doesn't seem very safe to me.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/10539" target="_self">delmoi</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5028049" target="_self">4:21 PM</a>  on June 10, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5028049" style="font-weight:normal;" title="3 users marked this as favorite">3 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br />
Sorry, your read is wrong. <br />
<br />
Signals Intelligence (which is what the NSA was started for) is concerned as much or more with communications <i>metadata</i> as with communications content.<br />
<br />
In a tactical military situation, even if I cannot decrypt enemy communications (or if I can and they are banal: &quot;Holding position. Send more MREs&quot;), it's of great interest to me if I can determine that <i>one set of messages</i> always comes from due North, and a distinct set is transmitted form due East. Banal or not, I can conclude I face at least two enemy units. If I can tell that the radio frequency or power transmission profiles of the Northern messages match those of tank company, and those more closely approximate what I'd expect from a an infantry platoon, I have an even better idea of what I'm facing.<br />
<br />
If my opponents are using a one time pad or even a code book, I can't reliably know if &quot;Let's get hotdogs tomorrow&quot; means &quot;the revolution has started&quot; or &quot;everybody bug out&quot;.<br />
<br />
In a civilian setting, if I know that every time Jack phones Bobby, Bobby within the next fifteen minutes calls Edgar and Sam, and five minutes of receiving Bobby's call, Edgar calls Clyde, I may have a good idea of the structure and size of my opponents' organization.  I may even have a better idea of it than my opponents do, assuming they're following good security compartmentalization. And I may know that even if I can't intercept Jack, intercepting Bobby will allow me to roll up his organization. Without ever having to figure out what &quot;Let's get hotdogs tomorrow&quot; means.<br />
<br />
Data-mining is the process of taking massive amounts of data (every American's every phone call to any one else) and sifting it for patterns. Finding social networks (graphs), whether they are criminal or not. And there's a rub. A guy cheating on his wife (or preparing to leave his job for a startup, or start a new church) may look very similar to someone trying to set up a terrorist organization. Equally easy for innocents to be swept up with the guilty: if Peter is calling you to join his steering committee to run for Congress, and he's also calling Seamus to co-ordinate raising funds for the IRA, well, both you and Seamus are (to borrow from the Social Networking sites) &quot;In Peter's network&quot;.<br />
<br />
Data mining isn't about reading the messages (again, a good criminal organization will make the messages innocuous or coded, in ways than cannot be easily decoded). It's about knowing who talks to to whom. Unfortunately, than means lots of false positives (anyone reminded of the no-fly list?) and lots of &quot;the algorithm picked him out, we don't even know why, but the machine told us to open an investigation of him&quot;. And then you're under suspicion until and unless an algorithm &quot;finds&quot; you not-guilty. Which of course never ever happens, because they'd rather a thousand false positives than one false negative that results in a terrorist incident and political consequences for them.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/21820" target="_self">orthogonality</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5028411" target="_self">9:01 PM</a>  on June 10, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5028411" style="font-weight:normal;" title="21 users marked this as favorite">21 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

The oligarchs are betting that the technology has made that change.

In 2008 there were a series of breaks in the undersea fiber optic cables that connected Iran to the rest of the world. The speculation was that the cables were tapped while they were intentionally broken. Here's a Wikipedia article on the cable breaks:<br />

Against an agreed allowance Jana should take care of the children. Besides, she wanted to attend a language course to improve their English. With their prospective host-father had regular contact via Facebook.<br />

Than the high school graduate finally landed in the U.S., it was taken away and questioned at passport control at the airport. The officials of the U.S. Immigration authorities wanted to know the nature of the visit and how long they would stay.<br />
<br />
Jana was prepared for such questions. She wanted to visit her parents and friends do an English course. Whether they be sure?, Officials wanted to know. Yes, she was sure. Whether they should also be sure?<br />
<br />
Finally, the officials baffled Jana submitted a printout of the entire Facebook correspondence with their host-father. My complaint: the young woman wanted to work illegally in the States. The authorities had Janas private messages in the social network Facebook apparently read along for weeks. Jana was not allowed to enter. The next flight brought the 18-year-old returned to Germany.</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/76412" target="_self">ob1quixote</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5028731" target="_self">6:11 AM</a>  on June 11, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5028731" style="font-weight:normal;" title="4 users marked this as favorite">4 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

If that is the case, all shared-key cryptography would be broken and about as easy for them to read as plain text.</i><br />
<br />
Factoring integers that are the result of multiplying two large primes is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization#Difficulty_and_complexity">not known to be an NP-complete problem</a>. A fast solution would be far less surprising than a general constructive proof that P=NP. Depending on the achievable speed-up, it could destroy RSA, but there are other publicy-key cryptography algorithms that rely on other problems that could be used instead.<br />
<br />
One problem I see with your conjecture is that these signal intelligence agencies often have a dual role: On the one hand they are tasked with cracking everybody elses codes, on the other hand they should help the government and companies to use secure communications and storage as well. If they had determined that RSA is flat-out broken, what guarantee is there that the Chinese or other countries have not discovered that as well?<br />
<br />
The effect of the leak is not so much that now the &quot;smart bad guys&quot; know specifics about the intercept capabilities, but that there is now a massively publicized discussion that leads to the &quot;dumb bad guys&quot; starting to maybe become a little more sophisticated. Before, those could be caught without even having to crack any encryption at all. And you can deduce a massive amount of information just from the meta-data of communication anyway, without having to comb through the contents at all.<br />

<a name="5028793"></a><div class="comments"><em>The CIA and NSA Inspectors General have robust whistleblower programs.</em><br />
<br />
This claim has already been addressed in general terms, but I just listened to an interview with William Binney, a whistleblower and a former employee of the NSA for nearly 40 years. Here's what happened to him, in his own words:
<blockquote>WILLIAM BINNEY: I had direct evidence that they were doing it, so I just couldn’t—I couldn’t stay there. I couldn’t be a party to that. And what I did after that was tried—I went to the intelligence committees first to try to get them alerted to it, so they would try—address it. I mean, their responsibility was to prevent the intelligence community from spying on U.S. citizens, based on the FISA laws. And after that, when that didn’t work, I even tried, with Diane Roark and others, to address this issue to the Chief Justice Rehnquist of the Supreme Court. But we weren’t able to do that. And so, eventually, I tried the—as well as Kirk Wiebe and I, we both tried to get to the Department of Justice inspector general’s office and alert them to this and say there are ways to do it without violating all the U.S. citizens’ privacy. But that wasn’t what the government wanted to do ... I tried to work internally in the government to get people to do something about it, but that whole process failed. So what it did was it alerted them to what I was doing, and they targeted me with the FBI, and they attempted to falsely prosecute me. Fortunately, I was able to get evidence of malicious prosecution every time, so they finally backed off trying to prosecute me.<br />
<br />
AMY GOODMAN: If you would briefly, though I don’t like to have you relive this, tell us what actually happened to you, with the FBI raiding your home.<br />
<br />
WILLIAM BINNEY: Well, they came in, and there were like 12 FBI agents with their guns drawn, and came in. My son opened the door, let them in, and they pushed him out of the way at gunpoint. And they came upstairs to where my wife was getting dressed, and I was in the shower, and they were pointing guns at her, and then they—one of the agents came into the shower and pointed a gun directly at me, at my head, and of course pulled me out of the shower.</blockquote>

At any rate: If the senior management of an organization has authorized illegal or unethical activities, it seems rather pointless for an employee to alert them of that behavior using their own whistleblower programs, doesn't it?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/142099" target="_self">compartment</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5028793" target="_self">6:45 AM</a>  on June 11, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5028793" style="font-weight:normal;" title="6 users marked this as favorite">6 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

The formal and informal sharing of data between Western intelligence agencies (and military special mission units) is a very badly kept secret.

First of all, that may not be true.  If you found a way to do an O(k<sup>n</sup>) calculation in O(n<sup>(10+k<sup>100</sup>)</sup>) that would mean P = NP but it would also mean no NP calculations can't ever be solved in any useful amount of time.  Polynomial time does not mean 'fast'

I kind of doubt that would ever happen, crypto researches tend to be among the most libertarian 'hacker ethos' types out there. It's likely that any advances in crypto theory would be posted online on academic forums, not kept secret at a place like RSA.  In fact, a secret algorithm wouldn't even help them - you can't sell crypto if you can't tell people how it works, because then they can't verify that it works.  Trying to use 'secret sauce' crypto to keep things secret is actually really dangerous.

Yeah no.  Someone brought this up the other day and it's just ridiculous.  The internet is stuffed with strong crypto, and it's becoming more encrypted by the day.

But not only that <b>every server on the internet</b> uses strong crypto for administration. Either using SSH or using microsoft's remote desktop stuff, which is also encrypted. <br />

1) Massive data mining and access program discovered at the NSA<br />
2) US government assures people that <b>US citizens</b> aren't being spied on. <br />
<br />
There's no evidence, nor is anyone in the US government even <i>claiming</i> that there isn't a free-for-all at the NSA for data from Germans or any other person who the NSA isn't 51% sure is an American. (And yes, they do use a 51% certainty cutoff, by the way) <br />
<br />
Suppose you found out that a restaurant chain was selling hamburgers that had been contaminated with Arsenic.  Would you keep eating there because you couldn't be 100% sure that the burgers <i>you</i> had arsenic in them? <br />
<br />
There seems to be this weird idea among some people that if we can't be 100% sure about this we can't be upset.  And, while that might be reasonable if you're in the US and you trust the US government, which says it's not spying inappropriately on US citizens, how does it even <b>begin</b> to make sense for someone <b>who isn't even American</b>, has no reason to trust the US government and who the US government isn't even claiming isn't being spied on? <br />
<br />
Would you trust the Chinese government with access to your personal files? Or the Russians, Iranians, etc? It's kind of amazing how some Americans feel people in other countries need to be loyal to and trust the US government. <br />

<blockquote><i> Corrente: Who Are We And Why Don't We Have Any Sense Of Proportion About Terrorism?</i></blockquote>

Who says we don't?  Isn't it possible that the American people do have a sense of proportion about turr, it's just that the surveillance state has billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs on the line and without the fear of turr as a justification they have no raison d'etre, no justification for their existence? That means a big portion of those outlays from the federal government come back in the form of lobbying, come back in the form of revolving door policies where people who work in government then go off and make massive bank working for private companies?  <br />
<br />
Look at Michael Chertoff, for example who bought those TSA x-ray scanners, then went to go work for the company that made them when he left government. <br />
<br />
It's not that the American People are terrified of terrorists, but rather everyone in D.C acts like were on the brink of catastrophe because if the fear subsides the cash cow dies. <br />
<br />
That said, though, it seems like a lot of people just don't understand proportions in general. I mean, like, I saw Bill Maher the other day saying he thought this might be OK because he was worried about getting nukes.  As if there were terrorists out there smart enough to build a nuke but too stupid not to chat about it on Facebook, or that it would be far easier and less invasive to simply monitor all the nuclear material out there rather then every single person.

<a name="5029047"></a><div class="comments">There are some things that you need to understand about the way IT contracting works in order to get why the Booz Allen thing and the three months time duration is a bit of a distraction.<br />
<br />
Typically on long running outsourced infrastructures there are a number of large components that can be or are aligned to a single vendor.   Often these components are under their own service agreements with durations from 12 to 36 months, in order to preserve the best pricing and/or best service for the components you will see the overlaid contracting company and consequently management swapped out at the expiration of a contract.    What often doesn't change is the actual engineers/analysts on the ground servicing the infrastructure.<br />
<br />
So while he may have only worked for Booz Allen for 3 months it's pretty likely that he worked possibly for a previous company in a similar or the same role and simply was picked up by Booz Allen as carry over talent.   We see this pretty frequently in the high end infrastructure management space for e-commerce/airlines/financial/etc.   It's essentially the same for government except those whole practices are walled off entirely and run as separate business entities (I work for one of the largest infrastructure management companies globally), but the model is essentially the same.<br />
<br />
To people asking how he got access to all this stuff and why didn't compartmentalization kick in, on pure speculation it's because of a few things:<br />
<br />
1) Cost<br />
2) Tools<br />
3) Process<br />
<br />
In the effort to provide lowered cost to deliver services what you have from a pure administrative side is leveraged service desks, and at a certain level above the service desk - level 3/4 support or indeed operation of a given application and stack you just end up with access to everything.   It's rare to build a dedicated team top to bottom to support a singular application stack because the cost model breaks down and the pricing is simply out of control. <br />
<br />
The tools used to instrument, maintain, manage and interact with managed systems and applications generally share a common back end across application stacks.   Even if the application stacks themselves are compartmentalized on the front end, there is almost always a common platform somewhere in the background that allows operators and support staff to interface with the raw systems.   Typically these things operate at the core of the onion like security model and are audited pretty thoroughly, but it again goes to costs associated with infrastructure management.<br />
<br />
The process of obtaining access in many teams supporting infrastructure and app stacks is that once access is granted at a specific level or once you have cause to use or support a singular tool at a specific privilege level that access doesn't get clawed back terribly frequently.   There are generally automated systems in place to bring back access that sits unused but one of the drawbacks (if not set up properly) of a unified authentication, authorization and audit platform governing access is that if it's not set up properly or to purpose and maintained properly and to purpose it goes a bit wild and organic on you in terms of privilege.   Simply accessing an app once can renew access at a similar privilege tier.<br />
<br />
I don't know what his job was in the environments he worked within, but in working with large amounts of data it is absolutely believable to me that someone with a solid background in systems administration and analysis of large systems would find themselves over the course of several years in a position as an actual end user of an application stack because they know how it's all built and are comfortable operating in systems that involve complex data streams and structures.<br />
<br />
In the industry supporting large complex systems it is not at all uncommon to find persons who are college drops outs (myself), or didn't graduate high school as senior resources or management of teams who support and use this stuff.   A high school diploma or a college degree isn't anything special in the context of competent complex systems administration or use.  What those things convey, in a very general sense, is a certain maturity level and they aren't the only way to get there.   <br />
<br />
If his salary from Booz Allen really was 122k, he's likely compensated significantly with a competitive bonus structure.   That can range anywhere from 15% to 30% if it's following industry norms.   Those structures are typically tied to billable hours, so if you bill a lot you make a lot more.   Nothing in this story strikes me as specifically surprising in terms of the surveillance itself and the access to data.   It's just how things are built.   It is to some extent the problem with trying to do more with less capital and be good stewards from a pure budgetary perspective with tax dollars.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/19895" target="_self">iamabot</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5029047" target="_self">8:41 AM</a>  on June 11, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5029047" style="font-weight:normal;" title="15 users marked this as favorite">15 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

This part of the press release is confusing:
<blockquote>Also of potential interest: Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who broke the surveillance story, says he has been working with Snowden since February.

<a name="5029115"></a><div class="comments">Wow, that David Brooks piece is amazing.  First of all, what's interesting is that his gradated levels of authority is basically the daoist/confucianist ideology of the Chinese emperors. They thought the father had authority over the family, the local leaders had authority over the families, all the way up to the emperor, but it's quite different from the Lockean philosophy of the founders<br />
<br />
That isn't to say he didn't have a point, I think if Snowden did have a family with children and was more engaged in his community it would certainly have been <i>harder</i> for him to leave.  But at the same time he misses that his Top Secret clearance meant he had to keep hidden and couldn't be open with people anyway.  It's not surprising that someone with a top secret clearance wouldn't want to be widely known in his neighborhood, in his girlfriends pictures with him is face is obscured. <br />
<br />
But the real crazy-ass stuff is this: 
<blockquote><i>For society to function well, there have to be basic levels of trust and cooperation, a respect for institutions and deference to common procedures. By deciding to unilaterally leak secret N.S.A. documents, Snowden has betrayed all of these things.</i></blockquote>

I mean, that's insane.  Institutions gain trust <b>by being trustworthy</b>.  I think Brooks shares this view with Obama, Obama took office he said he wanted to restore institutions and trust in institutions.  But instead of making things more transparent, is just <i>called himself transparent</i> while releasing self-serving and unimportant datasets, and cracking down on leaking.   Rather then trying to make government more ethical and therefore trustworthy, we should crack down on people who <b>reveal the government's flaws</b> <br />
<br />
It's totally backwards. 
<blockquote><i>But Big Brother is not the only danger facing the country. Another is the rising tide of distrust, the corrosive spread of cynicism, the fraying of the social fabric and the rise of people who are so individualistic in their outlook that they have no real understanding of how to knit others together and look after the common good. <br />
This is not a danger Snowden is addressing. In fact, he is making everything worse.</i></blockquote>

Yes, undoubtedly his revelation will make people more cynical.  But here you're blaming the messenger. 
<blockquote><i>He betrayed honesty and integrity, the foundation of all cooperative activity. He made explicit and implicit oaths to respect the secrecy of the information with which he was entrusted. He betrayed his oaths</i></blockquote>

Presumably he took an oath to uphold and defend the constitution, which he felt was being violated.
<blockquote><i>He betrayed his friends … He betrayed his employers. ... </i></blockquote>

Yeah, because he thought what they were doing was bad. 
<blockquote><i> He betrayed the cause of open government ... He betrayed the privacy of us all. </i></blockquote>

This some seriously twisted logic, just, totally backwards. 
<blockquote><i> He betrayed the Constitution. The founders did not create the United States so that some solitary 29-year-old could make unilateral decisions about what should be exposed.</i></blockquote>

Actually, they did.  The first amendment? Remember? That's what enabled this.  Even in the U.K, they have an official secrets act that can prevent newspapers from reporting stories.  Most other countries in the world could have clamped down on the press and prevented this story, but that couldn't happen in the U.S, because of the first amendment. So clearly, the constitution <b>does</b> allow it.   And by the way, anonymous pamphleteers were quite popular back in the day. 
<blockquote><i> On the other hand, he had made certain commitments as a public servant, as a member of an organization, and a nation. Sometimes leakers have to leak. The information they possess is so grave that it demands they violate their oaths. ... , Snowden was obsessed with the danger of data mining but completely oblivious to his betrayals and toward the damage he has done to social arrangements and the invisible bonds that hold them together.</i></blockquote>

What's interesting about this is that he is essentially describing corruption as a virtue.  People often think of corruption as bad people doing bad things, but what actually happens is that people become friends with people, and they then seek to help their friends out, so if one of their friends is doing something bad they'll defend them out of loyalty, and cognitive dissonance can take hold and they'll justify their friends actions.  <br />
<br />
Here, brooks is saying that we shouldn't betray our friends or our institutions even they are doing things we think is wrong. Somehow I doubt he would praise the friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev who ditched his laptop after the bombing out of loyally. I'm sure he'd be able to spew out some verbiage about how it's different, but his philosophy is half baked.  The problem is you have these 'layers' of hierarchal &quot;authority&quot;,  the problem is that one layer may be in conflict with another.  Maybe your friends with  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and you think he's a terrorist.  Do you betray him and rat him out, or do you betray the people who he's going to kill? It has to be one or the other. <br />
<br />
In this case Snowden felt that his <i>friends and employers and government</i> was betraying the nation, democratic accountability, the constitution, society, and the global  community (of individuals, not nations). If he didn't care about any of it, he would have stayed in Hawaii, made ton of cash and married his super-hot girlfriend. <br />
<br />
Also Brooks completely misses the fact that his layers of hierarchy thing only works if you think that the highest levels have your interests at heart. As a rich conservative white historically, and as simply a rich person today, that's true.  But certainly the government has clamped down on various groups in the past. What happens when you're a member of a minority group who's being oppressed? What if you have a family member beaten by the police and nothing is done (or he's slapped with false charges?).   What happens when you find out the government is spying on everyone even though the guy you voted for said he was against it? <br />
<br />
Brook's weirdly-Confucian ideology has no way to deal with conflicts between 'layers'. <br />
<br />
Frankly it sounds as though he's just spouting nonsense in order to justify his disdain.  What he's really angry about is the fact that <b>his friends and people in his social circle</b> were betrayed by him.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/10539" target="_self">delmoi</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5029115" target="_self">9:04 AM</a>  on June 11, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5029115" style="font-weight:normal;" title="16 users marked this as favorite">16 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Didn't he say he was making $200k/yr?  One of the things that annoys me the most about this is how much of our taxes must be getting thrown away on these projects that probably aren't anywhere near worth what we are paying for them, even if there is a reason to have them.

I get that this seems like a lot of money, or that the 20 million noted in the PRISM documents seems like a ton of money.   You need to understand that if the dollars are giving you heartburn, it's a patent distraction.   These dollar amounts are literally nothing in the world of complex high end application and infrastructure administration and management.   They are significant figures but not in the context of IT administration or application stacks.     This doesn't strike me as terribly wasteful to be honest because it's not outside the norms of costs for both resources and infrastructure management/analysis I've seen.     Complex systems and data structures are pricey, and that's true for all sectors.   There are efforts to drive down the costs but it's a pretty specialized industry and not at all like keeping a couple of PC's going on a LAN.<br />
<br />
So yes the money could be used elsewhere, absolutely, I get that seeing figures tossed around when you're looking at the health of other components of society or government is a challenge.   It's again, a distraction to the erosion of personal freedoms and civil liberties.   Those dollars don't even approach an insignificant digit of what is being spent to surveil persons, places or other entities.   Viewing these figures absent an understanding of how utterly vast the spending is focusses on the wrong thing in my opinion, which is what I believe to be a systemic and almost passive erosion of privacy rights.   We are, and have been, the proverbial boiling frog.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/19895" target="_self">iamabot</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5029234" target="_self">9:32 AM</a>  on June 11, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5029234" style="font-weight:normal;" title="4 users marked this as favorite">4 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<blockquote>“He played one of the most recognizable super heroes,” Fox News host Steve Doocy explained. “We’re talking about ‘The Incredible Hulk.’ Lou Ferrigno’s transformation put a memorable face on the conflicted character, leaving viewers wondering if he was a hero or if he was an evil villain.”<br />
<br />
“Proving truth is stranger than fiction, the emergence of the NSA leaker, Edward Snowden, has many wondering if his disclosure of government surveillance programs make him patriot or a traitor,” co-host Brian Kilmeade added.<br />
<br />
“So, how does The Incredible Hulk see it?” co-host Gretchen Carlson asked Ferrigno.<br />
<br />
“First of all, he must be having good Chinese food,” Ferrigno joked, noting that Snowed had fled to Hong Kong. “I would say it’s a flipped coin… I think leaking information was wrong, I think talking about the situation — I think he did commit a crime.”<br />
<br />
“People see him as either a hero or a traitor. But like I said, it’s a flipped coin.”</blockquote>

There are people who are going to form their opinion on this issue based on whether or not an actor who played a cartoon character 40 years ago got heads or tails. How can people be this dumb?

<blockquote>The idea here, which has quickly become the standard talking point for partisans trying to defend the NSA program and the Obama administration, is that while you may object to the NSA’s mass surveillance system, it is nonetheless perfectly legal as is the conduct surrounding it. Therefore, the logic goes, Snowden isn’t an honorable “whistle-blower” he’s a traitorous “leaker,” and the only criminal in this case is Snowden and Snowden alone.<br />
<br />
The first — and most simple — way to debunk this talking point is to simply behold two sets of testimony by Obama administration national security officials. In one, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper categorically denies that the government “collect(s) any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.” In another, the Guardian reports that NSA Director General Keith Alexander “denied point-blank that the agency had the figures on how many Americans had their electronic communications collected or reviewed.”</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/76412" target="_self">ob1quixote</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5029615" target="_self">11:20 AM</a>  on June 11, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5029615" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<blockquote>Though thoughtful, morally engaged and deeply committed to his beliefs, he appears to be a product of one of the more unfortunate trends of the age: the atomization of society, the loosening of social bonds, the apparently growing share of young men in their 20s who are living technological existences in the fuzzy land between their childhood institutions and adult family commitments.</blockquote>

Rather than an &quot;unmediated man,&quot; I think it's more charitable to view Snowden as something like a secular priest whose lack of a family and rejection of community bonds allows him to hew more closely to the dictates of his conscience without having to worry about someone at home who depends on him.<br />
<br />
We should be glad his conscience wasn't compromised by having a family. A society needs a certain number of people, like priests and radicals and iconoclasts, who are relatively untethered by social bonds.<br />

(David Brooks is a resume-fetishist, credential-sniffer, and hierarchy-lover, so it's not surprising that he does not understand someone who has rejected the standard path to success and done something that places himself at great personal risk, because that's beyond the realm of comprehension for a person with Brooks' weaselly, craven courtier mentality.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/175448" target="_self">Unified Theory</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5029646" target="_self">11:34 AM</a>  on June 11, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5029646" style="font-weight:normal;" title="8 users marked this as favorite">8 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Are you asking rhetorically or sincerely? I mean, as far as qualifications go, he had a  <b>Top Secret Security Clearance.</b>.  The field of talent with that clearance is a lot smaller, and so you have to pay a lot more. 
<blockquote><i>And he was a high school drop-out who had a stripper girlfriend, and somehow still got a security clearance?</i> -- raysmj </blockquote>

What is this crap?  He had a career, He dropped out of high school and joined the army, then got a job as a security guard with the CIA.  During that time he probably learned IT and administration, and used his <b>security clearance</b> to help him get high paying jobs. <br />
<br />
It's entirely possible that he was simply doing normal IT type work, but getting paid a lot because of his security clearances. Also, the guardian mentioned he had an &quot;expired diplomatic passport&quot;, so he was obviously sent around the world, although possibly just to do IT work at embassies and the like. <br />
<br />
As far as his girlfriend, what the fuck are you even talking about?  I looked for more info on her since the buzzfeed link and the dailymail is saying she was a ballerina, and performed with an acrobatic troupe. 
<blockquote><i>I thought lifestyle was a factor in those, and that you had to be a straight arrow all the way around, especially to get top dollar pay like that (which is not remotely easy to find now).</i> -- raysmj </blockquote>

Again, where are you getting this stuff?  What evidence is there he wasn't a &quot;straight arrow&quot;? <br />
<br />
<sub><sub>I don't know what the specific regulations are but as far as I know as long as you're not breaking the law, doing drugs, deep in debt or cheating on your wife or something like that you should be go.  (I would think that since this is the government I'm sure they have some kind of list of disqualifying things and if you don't fail then you get the job - but again I don't know)</sub></sub>
<blockquote><i>I'm surprised to see so many people so quick to claim him as a total hero ... None of you know him, know anything about his motivations other than what he's told you ... Anyway, the guy looks more like a symptom of a larger disease, from the info I'm getting now.</i> -- raysmj</blockquote>

Well, the fact that you apparently felt the need slander him and falsely call his girlfriend a stripper doesn't really lend a lot credence to your argument. 
<blockquote><i>Why not refrain from any judgment at all, until we know much, much more about the whole story? If we ever do at all? – raysmj</i></blockquote>

So... we should refrain from any judgment forever, potentially? Most of the relevant facts are classified, we'll never know them unless they're leaked. Which means, of course they'll reflect the ideology and goals of the leakers too. And also, there's an asymmetry.  People who leak the government's line are rarely punished while those don't face harsh penalties, so pro-government information is far more likely to leak then the other side. 
<blockquote><i><a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/06/11/david_brooks_the_last_stalinist/">David Brooks: The Last Stalinist</a></i></blockquote>

Hardly the last. <br />
<br />
Although one of the interesting things about cases like these is seeing the reactions of people in the upper echelons of government and the media as they rally around eachother.  Sure there's the argument that Manning's leaks were too broad in scope. <br />
<br />
But a lot of the arguments really show their true ideology.  Everyone likes to pretend that the US is all about liberty and freedom and bla bla bla but when cases like this come up the arguments against it can't rely on those premises. So they end up telling us what they really think.  <br />
<br />
So for example when Bruce Sterling criticized Wikileaks (before Bradley Manning was caught) his basic argument was that the US had to do bad things in order to procure a middle class life for the American people and we shouldn't talk about it because it was upsetting (or something, it didn't make much sense) <br />
<br />
Now we get David Brooks with his weird daoist hierarchy of authority thing, but it does fit well with the &quot;authoritarian&quot; style of conservatism where people are supposed to be deferential and subservient to their 'betters', which of course is more likely if they see those betters as being leaders of their hierarchal authority shell.<br />
<br />
Or when Jeff Toobin talks about Snowden's &quot;bizarre ideology&quot;, despite the fact that a pretty good chunk of the country would agree with the basic premise that the government shouldn't spy on people not suspected of a crime, that people in a democracy should be aware of it if their government is spying on massive numbers of people.  He might not agree with it but it certainly isn't an uncommon. <br />
<br />
His real anger seems to stem from the fact that Snowden was a <i>nobody</i>, that didn't deserve to make a decision with this much impact on policy because wasn't the right person, didn't have the right title. That he didn't know his place.  Toobin isn't a conservative, as far as I know, but he clearly thinks important decisions need to be made by the right people and the masses who actually vote on this stuff don't need to be informed, even if it affects their lives.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/10539" target="_self">delmoi</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5029909" target="_self">1:06 PM</a>  on June 11, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5029909" style="font-weight:normal;" title="11 users marked this as favorite">11 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br />
Let's slow down a second. What does related to the investigation of a particular thing have to do with the <em>constitutionality</em> of a search? Nothing. That's a question of whether the statute is being followed. Let us be 100% clear and technical here. Some may argue that section 1861 requires an investigation and that there is not one here. But whether or not 1861's requirements are followed <em>is irrelevant</em> to <em>whether or not there is a constitutionally-protected privacy interest</em> in the numbers that are called.<br />
<br />
The fact that it is one or many targeted lines is irrelevant to any constitutional analysis. Either a privacy interest exists in the dialed numbers, the fact and duration of the call exists or it does not. Its long settled. The <em>Smith</em> decision makes it clear, disclosure of the information to the phone company destroys the expectation of privacy.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/21020" target="_self">Ironmouth</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5029922" target="_self">1:10 PM</a>  on June 11, 2013 </span></div><br><br>

This is an area of clearly established law on the constitutional right. There's no way that the government could be found to not have qualified immunity in this situation. So there is no claim under <em>Bivens</em>. So no civil claim. Nor does the exlusionary rule apply in any civil case. No charges have been filed and the government has not tried to use the information in a criminal case without first getting a warrant. So no <em>Weeks</em> application of the exclusionary rule. So there is no remedy. This is not going to suddenly be declared a protected area after 40 years.

The fact that what he’s doing is against the law speaks for itself. I don’t think anyone doubts that narrow point. But he’s not just opening the thing up for debate. He’s taking it upon himself to make certain things no longer possible, or much harder to do. To me that’s a betrayal. I think it’s easy to exaggerate how much damage these disclosures cause. But I don’t buy that there are no consequences. And it goes to the point I was making in an earlier post. Who gets to decide? The totality of the officeholders who’ve been elected democratically - for better or worse - to make these decisions?

Again, we were reading JN-25 3 days before Pearl Harbor. Before the war. Should we all have decided whether it was OK for the US to do that in a big democratic vote? <br />
<br />
And what about Purple, the Japanese diplomatic code? Do we have to have a vote on cracking that code?<br />

Congratulations.  
<blockquote><i>The reason I brought that up was not to pass judgment but that having a girlfriend who was a self-described &quot;pole dancer&quot; would be a red flag for sort of severely uptight people running a security background check.</i></blockquote>

First of all I don't think that's true at all.  Second of all they did care about the guy's girlfriend I think they would have done an in-depth look as opposed to taking random out of context self descriptions off her blog.  <br />
<br />
Not that there's anything wrong with it professionally, but it may simply have been something she did as a hobby. She clearly did more 'normal' dance/acrobatics as well. With this guy salary it's not like she even needed to work. <br />
<br />
I just think calling him a &quot;A high school drop-out who had a stripper girlfriend&quot;, is inappropriate and insulting, for one thing, which weakens the argument that you were trying to be fair and even handed. <br />

I think historically there's been a certain kind of person drawn to computers and hacking and so on, but there's no reason to think that things are always going to be like that. There are smart people who don't share those views and people get seduced by money and power. 
<blockquote><i>Who gets to decide? The totality of the officeholders who’ve been elected democratically - for better or worse - to make these decisions?

Note that he made a mention of the fact that Snowden disagrees with his views. Why does that matter?  What happens if the officeholders hold views that the majority of the country disagrees with, and they got elected because they lied about what they thought? <br />
<br />
I read TPM blog from time to time and it doesn't surprise me at all that Josh Marshall not a fan of Snowden. He's obviously someone who trusts the government to go through his personal stuff, and trusts the people in power not to abuse those powers. But they may not be a majority, and if the programs are all secret and unknown, they can't be voted on in a democracy.<br />

Again, the idea that the people who are elected are the 'grownups' who get to decide these things because democracy has placed their imprimatur upon them to do whatever they want so long as it stays secret.<br />
<br />
But the basis of democracy is that citizens can hold people democratically accountable if they don't like their policies. That aspect of democracy breaks if the polices are all secret, and the voters don't know about them. <br />

It's the difference between whether you view &quot;America&quot; as the politicians and government officers or the citizens who actually vote, or whether the citizens upon voting for a candidate remain individuals who have their own views and interests or whether their political autonomy is sublimated and transferred to the people they vote for.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/10539" target="_self">delmoi</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5030218" target="_self">2:50 PM</a>  on June 11, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5030218" style="font-weight:normal;" title="4 users marked this as favorite">4 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

But how is the government supposed to both give the country a chance to decide on espionage policy and keep it secret from the targets of the espionage? Some of voting is making a decision about who you trust to do things (1) that are reactions to events and not part of a plan; and (2) that are secret and must remain so to be effective.<br />
<br />
Answering that question is the critical one here. Many of us feel like we elected a government for the very purpose of deciding what secret programs are right and which are wrong. Bush violated existing law with what he did. Obama pledged to keep within the law and he has done so.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/21020" target="_self">Ironmouth</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5030224" target="_self">2:54 PM</a>  on June 11, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5030224" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br />
<em>A.T. Kearney's Paul Laudicina offers three scenarios that depict possible visions of the global future.  Based on five key drivers of change -  globalization, demographics, consumption patterns, natural resources/environment and regulation/activism - the author envisions three possible and plausible scenarios for the ten-year global outlook.<br />
<br />
<strong> Scenario One: Castles and Moats.</strong> <br />
<br />
 “In this darkly pessimistic (though not necessarily most-probable) scenario, the world in 2015 is plagued with instability. Terrorist groups have continued their campaign of well-coordinated attacks against the United States and its institutions abroad. They succeeded in eroding global confidence in what was once seen as the world's preeminent political and economic superpower.  Although most of al Qaeda's leaders have been caught and killed, many questions are still unresolved. They include Palestinian statehood, ongoing conflicts in Central Asia and the Caucasus region, as well as worsening standards of living in Middle Eastern countries.  Fortress world -  As a result, among Western nations, national security trumps all other concerns. Civil liberties have taken a backseat to security concerns, as governments subject their citizens to constant surveillance.  With xenophobia on the rise, immigrants, foreign workers and even ethnic minorities are viewed with suspicion. Fewer and fewer people are willing to travel, work or live abroad, knowing that they will be subjected to intense scrutiny.  As a siege mentality sets in, rising nationalist and populist sentiment is the catalyst for heightened levels of economic protectionism. </em><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/23476" target="_self">infini</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5030289" target="_self">3:25 PM</a>  on June 11, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5030289" style="font-weight:normal;" title="4 users marked this as favorite">4 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

This is kind of a contradictory statement by Obama. He is saying we shouldn't just rely on trust, but then he goes on to say that we have no other choice. The only thing you can do is trust the secret system. And what are these problems he speaks of? A more transparent government with more accountability? I am willing to trade a little security for that, if that is what he means. Moreover, I would have more faith in the secret system of oversight he mentions if the FISA court actually rejected any requests for surveillance warrants. Of the thousands requested each year, none are rejected and only a small number (less than 5%) require any modification. Either the folks making these requests are super good at working within the established law or the FISA court is a rubber stamp.

Well, they can't.  But the problem here is the assumption that democracy is something that the government 'gives' to the people. Obviously they can make attempts to keep things secret if they want, but that's not going to work very well if the stuff you're doing conflicts with the values you espouse.  <br />
<br />
There is obviously an inherent conflict that can't be resolved, but, you can end up with an equilibrium where the worse something is, the more likely it is to be leaked, and each person who holds the secret can chose to leak it if they think it's worth the cost. <br />
<br />
If you grant security clearance based on how loyal people are to America and American ideals, then people are going to betray the government if they feel that the government is betraying the people. 
<blockquote><i>Answering that question is the critical one here.</i></blockquote>

Critical for what? There's no reason it needs to be answered.  Some forms of government make some things really difficult and other things impossible.  Those are sacrifices that have to be made if you want that kind of government. 
<blockquote><i>Some of voting is making a decision about who you trust to do things</i></blockquote>

No, voting is voting. It means whatever the person voting wants it to mean and it certainly doesn't mean they <b>trust</b> they person they're voting for, they may just fear or distrust the other side more. 
<blockquote><i>Many of us feel like we elected a government for the very purpose of deciding what secret programs are right and which are wrong.</i></blockquote> <br />
<br />
Uh, that's nice?  We know you don't personally like Snowden, we understand that you think the government should be able to do whatever it wants in secret whether or not voters ever find out about it, we know you think winning an election means that voters have entrusted them with the right to lie to them about what they're actually doing. <br />

<a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/magic-cryptography">In the mid‐1930s, the U.S. Navy concentrated on Japanese naval cryptographic systems while the U.S. Army Signal Intelligence Service (SIS), under the direction of William F. Friedman, tackled Japanese diplomatic codes. By 1935, the SIS managed to crack Japanese diplomatic messages encrypted by the sophisticated “Red Machine,” which was put into use in the early 1930s. The accomplishments of Friedman and his team were short‐lived because in late 1938, the Japanese foreign ministry introduced a new and more secure cipher machine, the “Purple Machine,” for its top‐secret messages. By the spring of 1939, the new Purple Machine replaced much of the Red Machine traffic. As a result, the SIS found that its vital source of intelligence on Japanese intentions and developments dried up completely. Immediately, Friedman and a group of SIS colleagues focused their attention on unraveling this setback. Friedman benefited immensely from the input of his team, including mathematicians, cryptanalysts, and linguists. They worked laboriously for the next eighteen months to solve Purple and also to construct a Purple Machine.<br />
<br />
The breaking of Purple was such a daunting and seemingly unachievable endeavor that Brig. Gen. Joseph O. Mauborgne, chief signal officer, referred to the cryptanalysts as “magicians” and to their results as “magic.” From then onward, the codeword MAGIC was given to the solution of Japanese diplomatic messages that were encrypted by the Purple Machine.</a><br />

It's not like there's any real ability for anyone to look at a bank of servers and say &quot;oh, that one is scooping up Facebook posts from German teenagers, that's illegal and you need to turn it off, but this one over here, this one is just looking at specific US citizens with court-approved surveillance orders, so it's cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
There's absolutely no way for the NSA's statements about their servers to be proven as anything other than they say it is, because it's a frigging computer and you can't just pop the lid and look inside.<br />
<br />
That's why this is on one hand a fucking farce, and on the other hand a very real chance for change.  If people realize that the NSA simply cannot be trusted to answer truthfully because there is no way to verify their statements, then there's a slim chance that the whole thing will get pulled down to the bricks.... nah, there isn't.

<br />
 <em>Here is a brief overview of these highly detailed scenarios.  <br />
<br />
Scenario 1) Fortress skcolidloG (Goldilocks in reverse).  “This is a world of high technology in which fierce competition reigns, with conflict over everything from resources to religion. Rapid development of technology is valued as a means of enhancing security. It is a world of trade blocs and protectionism, slowing the  distribution of resources worldwide and eventually slowing growth - and making it potentially very unequal between economies. This is the world economists and policy makers hoped would never emerge again after the lessons of the 1930s. Insecurity is real, not just a high perception of insecurity. (Goldilocks economy refers to an economy where the pace of growth is just right, not too hot and not too cold.) This scenario finds the military driving R&amp;D and innovation in search  of greater security, yet security is in reality (not just in perception) much worse than today. The high level of insecurity drives the world into introverted blocs.

And his voting record?
<blockquote>A spokeswoman for Franken subsequently noted that the senator voted against the Patriot Act reauthorization in 2011 over similar concerns that the final version didn't include adequate transparency or privacy protections.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sen. Franken voted against reauthorizing the FISA Act because of the lack of transparency after he cosponsored and voted for three separate amendments that would have improved the bill on transparency and privacy,&quot; Franken press aide Alexandra Fetissoff said.</blockquote>

It's kind of ironic, one of the specific things Obama criticized Bush on was classifying OLC memos. 
<blockquote><i>I suspect Franken (like a lot of Congresspeople) is just too technologically illiterate to have a good handle on what either SOPA/PIPA or this stuff really means.</i></blockquote>

Please. Franken is by far one of the most technologically literate senators out there.  He supported SOPA/PIPA because he believed it in it, because he's a Hollywood guy and I'm sure he gets a lot of financial support from them. During the fight against it, when many people were dropping their support for the bill, he hung on till the bitter end.   (I brought this up in another thread, and someone linked to some comments of his which were your typical politician B.S. type stuff) <br />
<br />
As far as the patriot act, was that from his own website or something? He voted <a href="http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/108924/al-franken/13/civil-liberties-and-civil-rights#.UbgGdZzLBuQ">for cloture</a> on the patriot act renewal.  That's the vote that actually matters, with the way the senate works these days. And the patriot act is only one vote of many.  <br />
<br />
It's certainly a good sign that he's on this bill, but yeah, acting like he's some crusading hero against government power is quite a stretch.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/10539" target="_self">delmoi</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5030851" target="_self">10:34 PM</a>  on June 11, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5030851" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Oh yes it does -- it lets the public know how far it's gone in concrete terms.  In a democracy, good lasting change always begins with the opinions of the people.  If the people are not in favor of a thing, then even if a politician does something objectively good it's not likely to last.  I think that ultimately Snowden's greatest thing may turn out to be just getting the public riled up enough about it to <i>do</i> something -- which is part of why I view people still trying to play the &quot;oh it's not really so bad&quot; game with some amount of contempt.  It really is that bad, don't be so damn apathetic.<br />
<br />
<i> and I am not confident that an &quot;informed public debate&quot; [Wyden] would yield reform against the powerful moneyed interests, who would of course have pre-rigged any &quot;debate.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Of course the cynical pose is often right, and it's always a fight to get real change done.  But that is as it should be.  The real battle is of public opinion, and why should random voters listen to any one of us, just because we tell them we're right?  Anyone can do that.  We must show them how far it's gone, appeal to their better natures, use logic and reasoning.  That's the only proper way to change the world; anything else is a cheat, and the forces of the lazy, the apathetic, the brazen and the selfish arrayed against us are a lot better at cheating than we are.<br />

   _ That the propriety of the policy would never be a campaign issue, and could not be raised by challengers in Congressional races.<br />
<br />
   _  That it would never be subject to challenge in open court.<br />
<br />
Is that acceptable to Marshall?<br />
<br />
I'd like to hear his general theory of legitimate government. Does it include policies adopted in secret and run totally outside the normal methods of accountability? Are those just as legitimate as any other policy? If so, Marshall's theory of government isn't a Madisonian democracy. <br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
What Marshall doesn't grasp is that -- like Edward Snowden's leak -- secrecy itself renders &quot;certain things no longer possible.&quot; What's more damaging to representative democracy, denying government its secret policies, or denying the citizenry the ability to influence major policy debates?</blockquote>

<br />
But I also had in mind making it a bit more of a threat to bottom lines of the private companies involved, and apply some pressure from the internet public (as in SOPA/PIPA) to get them more aggressive in resisting and demanding accountability and lobbying on behalf of limiting government's access to their data, which is of course our data too (YMMV depending on user agreement).  Interestingly, today both Google and Facebook are supposedly making noises about wanting to reveal the extent of the requests they have complied with.  I think they are feeling some heat both from their userbase (and they have great tools to read the pulse of the public mood) and from their people, many of whom are products of a pretty savvy IT subculture that is politicized around these issues already. <br />

Yeah, he was supposed to be giving another big outdoor speech in Germany, like the one he gave during his campaign - before the leaks he had an 82% approval rating there.   Now he's German officials comparing the NSA to the Stasi. <br />
<br />
Since he's been president Obama comes across as kind of smug and condescending, especially when talking to people more liberal then he is, and particularly on civil liberties.  He does this thing all the time where he basically summarizes the other person's argument, then gives the counter argument (The classic example: &quot;no one is above the law, but let's look forward not backwards&quot; on prosecuting bush people on torture) <br />
<br />
Anyway, rather then taking civil liberties seriously he ignored people who had concerns and plowed ahead with these programs, keeping them classified and using national security rules to keep them from being litigated. <br />
<br />
Anyway, nice to see his Hubris in trusting the surveillance state, ignoring of warnings on civil liberties, and clampdown on leakers all bite him in the ass at once. 
<blockquote><i> It is making the constitutional lawyer squirm.</i></blockquote> <br />
<br />
I've always thought people kind of misunderstood what &quot;constitutional lawyer&quot; meant.  They assume if someone is a constitutional lawyer they must be &quot;pro-constitution&quot;, but obviously the other side needs lawyers too, they need people to try to twist the words to argue that things like PRISM are constitutional. <br />
<br />
I actually saw a &quot;constitutional lawyer&quot; on TV argue that the 4th amendment doesn't actually require warrants at all.  This was on a discussion on Chris Hayes show about the new SCOTUS ruling on DNA collection.  He said the 4th amendment only requires reasonable cause because the exact words: <br />
<br />
&quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against <b>unreasonable searches and seizures</b>, shall not be violated, and <b>no Warrants shall issue</b>, but upon probable cause, supportedby Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized&quot;<br />
<br />
Do not literally say that searches require warrants, only that they not be &quot;unreasonable&quot; - apparently the fact that the next <i>half of the sentence</i> talks about warrants is just a coincidence, it's totally unrelated to the first half. <br />
<br />
Then he went on to say that &quot;solving a crime&quot; is a &quot;reasonable&quot; thing to do, so collecting DNA from people, even if there is no reason to suspect they've been involved in any particular crime at all. <br />
<br />
Because the probable cause stuff is just about <i>Warrants</i> not about <i>searches</i> they just have to be &quot;reasonable&quot; - although it's not at all clear what purpose warrants are even supposed to serve, in his mind. <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/all-in-632013-recap-no-more-secrets.html">here's a link</a><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/10539" target="_self">delmoi</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5031449" target="_self">9:45 AM</a>  on June 12, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5031449" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

That's a good and valid point on the legal definition of treason. But he's most certainly going to be branded as a traitor and committing treason in the public sphere, as we've already seen. Also, a case could probably be made that he aided and abetted the enemy by releasing details of the system used to hunt for terrorism.

<blockquote><i>Snowden announced today he will stay in Hong Kong</i></blockquote>

Wow, that NYT article really makes it sound as though Hong Kong was a terrible choice, but it also sounds like most of their sources working with the US government. 
<blockquote><i> Mr. Snowden’s decision to stay in Hong Kong came as a person with knowledge of the Hong Kong government’s work on the case said local government lawyers, working with United States government lawyers, had identified 36 offenses with which Mr. Snowden could be charged under both Hong Kong and American laws.<br />
<br />
... any attempt by the United States to extradite Mr. Snowden would have to cite offenses that violate the laws in both countries, are punishable by jail terms of a year or more and meet the terms of that agreement. One of the 36 offenses involves the release of official secrets, which is illegal in Hong Kong and the United States, said the person familiar with Hong Kong government efforts, .... <br />
<br />
Mr. Snowden could delay extradition proceedings by requesting political asylum in Hong Kong. But he will almost certainly be taken into custody and jailed as soon as he files for asylum, because he would no longer qualify as a visitor to Hong Kong, the person said. <br />
...<br />
 An ideological divide has opened in Hong Kong’s legal profession over how long Mr. Snowden can manage to avoid extradition to the United States. Some human rights lawyers say he could resist for years, partly by filing for asylum, although they predict that he would eventually lose his case and be sent back. <br />
</i></blockquote>

It seems strange to think that a guy this careful in other ways would just throw darts at a board and hope for the best, and apparently spurn Russia's offer to host him, presumably because people would say he was <i>definitely</i> a turncoat if he traveled there.

You can't have a conflict of interest in talking to a reporter.

Really now? Could you cite some sources? I'd love to read more about the US cyberespionage campaign against China. I'll take any reputable sources you have; newspapers, cryptome leaks, WikiLeaks, hell even some 4chan posts if there's some evidence backing it up.<br />
<br />
It's a reasonable assumption that the US government has been &quot;hacking China&quot;, for years, by which I assume we mean both Chinese government and Chinese corporate interests. Just like they've been hacking us. But it was only a few years ago with Google' revelations that we had broad public confirmation of persistent attacks from China. And to this day the documentation that they are Chinese military is still tenuous, although it's certainly the most plausible assumption.<br />
<br />
&quot;We all know the US is spying on China&quot; is speculation. So is &quot;We know the NSA has been wiretapping Americans&quot;. It's probably true, but someone like Snowden actually documenting it in fact  is an important difference.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/15582" target="_self">Nelson</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5032279" target="_self">3:11 PM</a>  on June 12, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5032279" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Hong Kong is a particularly interesting choice though that puts him squarely into the middle of some crazily complicated relationships.

If this isn't resolved quickly, hundreds of thousands are already set to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1_July_marches">take to the streets of Hong Kong</a> in protest, as they do very July 1 (a pro-Snowden rally is already planned for this weekend).

<a name="5032390"></a><div class="comments">I spoke imprecisely in using the word &quot;wiretapping&quot;. Snowden has not documented <i>wiretapping</i> Americans. He documented a blanket copying of all metadata about phone calls, effectively a Verizon-wide pen register, not a wiretap. Also the PRISM documents allege widespread cooperation between American Internet companies in providing NSA access to private American data files. I'm not sure whether any of those files include voice, so that may not technically be &quot;wiretapping&quot; (itself a strangely obsolete word, seeing as how there are frequently no wires).<br />
<br />
Can we at least agree that Snowden has brought new documentation on NSA accessing various kinds of American communications data? I'm not sure what the &quot;since 2005&quot; part means.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made similar claims. At a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee last March, he was asked, “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?” To which Clapper responded, “No, sir.” The documents released by Snowden, pointing to the nationwide collection of telephone data records and not denied by government officials, prove the responses untrue.</blockquote>It's easy to be a cynical leftist and roll your eyes and say &quot;see, the US was spying all along&quot;.

The stories in the wake of the Snowden documents seems to have some momentum, bouncing back and forth across the Atlantic.

Talk about Orwellian.  I think with wikileaks they said people weren't allowed to read the memos themselves, not that they weren't allowed to read coverage of it or do Google searches -- essentially having a security clearance now requires you be ignorant of facts that are widely known to the public. <br />

It's ironic, but it's also creepy to think that people who want positions in the security bureaucracy are going to have to <i>actively avoid</i> knowing certain things.

<br />
The verizon records order is from the FISA court and presumably hangs it hat on the ruling that phone records (in at least one case) was not deemed protected by the 4th amendment. That the phone records are provided without peoples' names and addresses attached may make a difference in the technical legality, but may not make much difference to the public reading the newspapers.<br />
<br />
PRISM, with just the very little that has been provided so far (is there a conspiracy with the Guardian and WAPO to keep it shrouded in mystery?) looks to me precisely the sort of program put into place to service warranted intercepts of voice, video, email IM traffic. And the responses from Google et al seem to bear that out. <br />
<br />
Both of these seem to be repeats of the things that we already hashed out in the Patriot act and reauthorization fights. I keep waiting for a bombshell to come from Snowden - and I expect there will be one - since only the tiniest of what he took has been released.<br />
<br />
But to my un-trained eye, both of these programs seem to be exactly what we expected the Patriot act to allow. Now if this news story gets the repeal or drastic pull back of that act, that'd be great. I would like the repeal to be based on fact and cool-headed analysis of the trade-offs and not the &quot;He's  a Traitor/No he's a hero/Wait here's a picture of his girlfriend/ZOMG everything everywhere is being recorded!&quot; arguments that are swirling around.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/40032" target="_self">nightwood</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5032540" target="_self">5:15 PM</a>  on June 12, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5032540" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Did I say I was upset people disagreed with me? What arguments of substance would those be? Just asserting that something is ok because it's legal isn't substantive.

David Brooks goes to great length explaining how 29-year-old Edward J. Snowden betrayed the trust of so many social institutions, and then blames the age of isolation. What about the government’s betrayal of our privacy rights and the Bill of Rights?<br />
<br />
I commend Mr. Snowden for his solitary commitment to doing what is right. So many others would be cowed by the institutions of authority.<br />

If you want to change the world, there are things you can do. Some are politically cheap, and have little if no effect: Politely swaying in unison singing &quot;This Little Star of Mine&quot; in a little-traveled city park for a police-agreed 30 minutes, for example. Some come at great personal cost, and can be earth-shaking; Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden both took this route. <br />

Whatever you do, be it merely speaking your mind when you normally wouldn't, doing investigative journalism, protesting, leaking, or throwing yourself in front of the President's limo, in order to be effective you have to assume a certain amount of inconvenience and risk.

Some journalists had complaints about the stories ... because of what they said was imprecise reporting but others because of details the stories did not disclose. ...<br />
<br />
&quot;We know there is the capability for massive surveillance,&quot; said one reporter, who has covered U.S. spycraft for decades and asked not to be named so as not to alienate the NSA reporters. &quot;The thing they needed to do was say to Snowden, 'Don't give up your career for this. You stay there and find for me where specifically they are cheating on this.'&quot;<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Greenwald said a new round of stories would buttress the notion that NSA spying was more widespread even than many of its purported legislative overseers had imagined. Explaining a brief lull in the publication, he said: &quot;We felt like we needed to let these first stories seep in a bit before we started our next round. We didn't want to just suffocate people.&quot;<br />

<blockquote>

Even more disturbing is what appears to have motivated Snowden to expand his leaking beyond the borders of the United States and into the world of foreign espionage.<br />
<br />
Despite making a pretty good living for quite a few years through his employment as a small cog in the gears of government surveillance activities, Snowden declared, during a live chat with the Guardian on Monday, that he believes that “all spying is wrong.” And because it is Snowden’s personal judgment that all spying is wrong, he also believes it appropriate that he reveal our covert activities to affected foreign governments without a shed of concern for what the rest of his fellow Americans might think about this.<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
What should further concern us all is not just that Edward Snowden has decided that we must now live with his judgments and moral determinations when it comes to how we conduct foreign policy, but that those judgments are based on a shocking degree of naiveté as Snowden doesn’t seem capable of grasping that in the world in which we live, our allies are not always our friends.<br />
<br />
Snowden also appears to have missed civics class on the day when it was explained that the United States is a Republic where we elect people to make decisions on these matters and then judge the effectiveness of those decisions by deciding who we will keep in office and who we will turn away.<br />

But we can't do our job as citizens if &quot;the surveillance state&quot; is kept entirely secret, and I have doubts that congress and the FISA courts have enough visibility to insure the surveillance industry isn't violating the law -- even if they cared enough to do their jobs.  Overall, I think Snowden has done us a favor.  I doubt he has revealed anything that significant to China that they didn't already have, but who knows.  And now the world's attention is focused on what amount of surveillance and spying that is acceptable in the practical reality we live in, where the cold war still looms on and we probably should take terrorism seriously, and the vast majority of people are not committed to anarchist libertarianism.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/148857" target="_self">Golden Eternity</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5045211" target="_self">9:07 AM</a>  on June 20, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5045211" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<blockquote>

I don’t have any objection to Snowden being charged under more narrow statutes specifically dealing with releasing classified information; as Greenwald says, one element of civil disobedience is accepting the legal penalty. But the Espionage Act of 1917 is some of the worst legislation ever passed by the United States Congress, leading to such outcomes as being given a 10 year jail sentence and stripped of basic rights of citizenship for giving a speech. It has generally been unenforced since the Wilson administration until for very good reason; its overbreadth criminalizes basic political dissent. Its sudden and disgraceful revival under the Obama administration is an excellent illustration of the dangers inherent in keeping dangerous legislation on the books while trusting the executive branch not to start selectively enforcing it; to paraphrase Robert Jackson, the statute lies about like a loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need. <br />

<a name="5049901"></a><div class="comments">From today's NYT article on Snowden's flight to Moscow:<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Snowden is traveling with one other person, with the surname Harrison, but the agent declined to release the other traveler’s first name, saying that she did not have the authorization to do so. The Hong Kong Bar Association Web site does not list any lawyers with the family name Harrison.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
WikiLeaks, the organization that released extensive classified American diplomatic communications three years ago, said in a statement on its Twitter feed that it had “assisted Mr. Snowden’s political asylum in a democratic country, travel papers” and safe exit from Hong Kong. WikiLeaks did not identify the country; Mr. Snowden had previously expressed an interest in going to Iceland, a country with a history of strongly defending Internet freedoms, although it is less clear that the current government wishes to become involved in such disputes.<br />
<br />
In a follow-up Twitter posting at 5:20 a.m. New York time, WikiLeaks said that, “Mr. Snowden is currently over Russian airspace accompanied by WikiLeaks legal advisers.” A close adviser to Julian Assange, who orchestrated the release of the diplomatic cables three years ago, is named Sarah Harrison, prompting speculation that she was the Harrison on the flight with Mr. Snowden.</em><br />

HKSAR Government issues statement on Edward Snowden<br />
***************************************************<br />
<br />
     The HKSAR Government today (June 23) issued the following statement on Mr Edward Snowden:<br />
<br />
     Mr Edward Snowden left Hong Kong today (June 23) on his own accord for a third country through a lawful and normal channel.<br />
<br />
     The US Government earlier on made a request to the HKSAR Government for the issue of a provisional warrant of arrest against Mr Snowden. Since the documents provided by the US Government did not fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law, the HKSAR Government has requested the US Government to provide additional information so that the Department of Justice could consider whether the US Government's request can meet the relevant legal conditions. As the HKSAR Government has yet to have sufficient information to process the request for provisional warrant of arrest, there is no legal basis to restrict Mr Snowden from leaving Hong Kong.<br />
<br />
     The HKSAR Government has already informed the US Government of Mr Snowden's departure.<br />
<br />
     Meanwhile, the HKSAR Government has formally written to the US Government requesting clarification on earlier reports about the hacking of computer systems in Hong Kong by US government agencies. The HKSAR Government will continue to follow up on the matter so as to protect the legal rights of the people of Hong Kong.<br />
<br />

<blockquote>

<b>MOSCOW – June 23, 2013</b> – NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden left Hong Kong on an Aeroflot flight to Moscow. His ultimate destination is thought to be Venezuela by way of Havana. However, during Snowden’s Moscow stopover, he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stole his laptop.<br />
<br />
“He said he wanted to see my laptop, so I showed it to him in the airport lounge,” said Snowden. “Putin picked it up and said, ‘I could kill someone with this.’”<br />
<br />
“I reached out to take it back, but his secret service guys surrounded him, and he walked out of the airport with my fucking laptop!” Snowden continued. “Son of a bitch!”<br />
<br />
Guardian columnist Glenn Greenwald did not immediately respond to a request for comments.<br />

<blockquote>

If you had any hope that a coalition of lefties and libertarians, including right-leaning Paulite libertarians, might ultimately pressure the U.S. government to dial down NSA surveillance, and if you were taking comfort in the fact that even non-Paulites on the right have been accusing President Obama of using the NSA as Big Brother, well, forget it, because that's over: Snowden is consorting with four entities the mainstream right deeply distrusts -- China, Cuba, Venezuela, and Wikileaks -- and that fact is going to drive right-wing reactions to Snowden from now on. <br />
<br />
Pretty much everyone on the right, including Fox and talk radio, is going to take the McCain/Graham line henceforth: no more talk about excessive surveillance, and a lot of talk about how weak Obama has been as Snowden has jetted around the world, with the aid of America's enemies. I know Chavez is gone, but his party is still in power in Venezuela, and if Snowden isn't extradited -- I assume he won't be -- Obama's failure to get him back will be deemed by the right as effectively canceling out the killing of bin Laden.<br />
<br />
The right is always more comfortable arguing that Democrats are weak on defense, and the mainstream press is usually very eager to accommodate of this point of view. Post-Iraq syndrome has helped Obama, as has his willingness to continue many Bush-era policies apart from fighting the Iraq War endlessly, but I imagine the Beltway Establishment will enjoy the opportunity to revert to the old stereotypes: GOP as patriotic war daddies, Democrats as feckless weaklings. So here it comes again.<br />

There is the irony inherent in all this noise making (ref some link to politicians speak out about how nasty Russia is etc). If I'm not mistaken, it takes a certain amount of social, and perhaps, moral capital in order to apply pressure which is not physical strength or threats of force, and expect to be taken seriously. <br />

“Cancelling Snowden’s passport and bullying intermediary countries may keep Snowden permanently in Russia,” WikiLeaks said in its Twitter feed.<br />

Mr. Putin said Mr. Snowden had no intelligence value for Russia. <br />

Where the agency lacks the technical capability to gather data in bulk, it will and has focussed on developing the technical capability and in turn will deploy that capability when developed.<br />
<br />
The agencies role is to gather as much data as possible for downstream analysis.   It shouldn't be a shock that they turned out to be pretty good at defining capabilities and then use them, because it's their charter.   They will absolutely turn to the private sector for development, and have pretty consistently.<br />
<br />
Whether that charter to sweep in data is an overreach is I suppose a matter of opinion - political, personal, and legal.   But don't be surprised that the agency or others like it domestic and foreign are doing this.   They appear to have focussed solely on the analysis of the data after it's swept in as a matter of policy.   Using policy to define limits of targeting and for mitigation.   It would be pretty safe to assume that unless your data and communication is peer to peer and happening in meat space, it's being recorded.  If it's encrypted it's being stored off for potential downstream analysis if there is a technology breakthrough in decryption techniques or a need arises to focus resources on retrieving keys to that encrypted data the hard way.   Kind of a bummer in many respects.   We know most of this because of basic technology capabilities and because of the leaks themselves.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/19895" target="_self">iamabot</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5059552" target="_self">10:12 AM</a>  on June 27, 2013 </span></div><br><br>

I think we all know how valueless foreign intelligence is: the attack on the World Trade Center, the Arab Spring, the fall of the Soviet Union, all caught the USA off-guard. Conversely, even East Germany's obsessive self-scrutiny didn't preserve it when its people had had enough. There's simply <em>too much</em> information and, paradoxically, not enough. An intercepted conversation tells you what two people were saying at <em>that</em> time to each other, but it doesn't tell you what they said to different people at different times, or their actual thoughts at the time, or indeed the decision that they will end up making. How much better it is to be  told about <em>actual</em> decisions once they are made, whether or not they are made public. How silly it is to compromise that relationship for something as vain and evanescent as a taped phone call.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/40518" target="_self">Joe in Australia</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5063811" target="_self">1:01 AM</a>  on June 30, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5063811" style="font-weight:normal;" title="6 users marked this as favorite">6 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Here is Obama's statement about wheeling and dealing for Snowden:<blockquote>&quot;I'm not going to have one case with a suspect who we're trying to extradite suddenly be elevated to the point where I've got to start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a whole host of other issues, simply to get a guy extradited so he can face the justice system,&quot; Obama said at a joint news conference with Senegal's President Macky Sall.

Seeking asylum in Russia while protesting US government intrusion doesn't sound credible. <br />

Why would you possibly think this is the case? Amnesty International doesn't think so, and their original <em>raison d'être</em> was protecting prisoners of conscience. If the experience of other people accused of espionage is a guide then Snowden would have been swiftly arrested and imprisoned without bail or necessarily any charge. He'd have been kept in maximum-security conditions for a few years, and quite likely tortured by jailors pretending that he was a security or suicide risk. Then he'd have been hit with a huge list of charges carrying ridiculous penalties, and be expected to plea bargain down to ones carrying a penalty of, say, thirty years to life. There would be hardly any appearance in an open court, and that would be basically an opportunity to plead guilty to the &quot;reduced&quot; sentence. And even then the government might renege on its bargain and negotiate a more severe penalty in a secret session with the judge. Basically, if Snowden returns to the USA he's totally screwed.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/40518" target="_self">Joe in Australia</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5068818" target="_self">6:49 PM</a>  on July 2, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5068818" style="font-weight:normal;" title="9 users marked this as favorite">9 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

.......<br />
<em>Rubén Saavedra, the defense minister, who was on the plane with Mr. Morales, accused the Obama administration of being behind the action by France and Portugal, calling it “an attitude of sabotage and a plot by the government of the United States.”<br />
<br />
There was no immediate response by officials in Washington.<br />
<br />
“We were in flight; it was completely unexpected,” Mr. Saavedra said on the Telesur cable network. “The president was very angry.”</em><br />
......<br />
<em>Bolivian officials said they were working on a new flight plan to allow Mr. Morales to fly home. But in a possible sign of further suspicion about the passenger manifest, Mr. Saavedra said that Italy had also refused to give permission for the plane to fly over its airspace. Later he said that France and Portugal had reversed course and offered to allow the plane to fly through their airspace after all.</em><br />
.....<br />
<em>The problems began even before Mr. Morales left Moscow, Mr. Choquehuanca said. On Monday, Portugal, without explanation, had withdrawn permission for Mr. Morales’s plane to stop in Lisbon to refuel, the foreign minister said. That required Bolivian officials to get permission from Spain to refuel in the Canary Islands.<br />
<br />
The next day, after taking off from Moscow, Mr. Morales’s plane was just minutes from entering French airspace, according to Mr. Saavedra, when the French authorities informed the pilot that the plane could not fly over France.</em><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/175448" target="_self">Unified Theory</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5069369" target="_self">6:10 AM</a>  on July 3, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5069369" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

I was thinking of the Civil Rights Movement and King's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_from_Birmingham_Jail">Letter from a Birmingham</a> jail, which did a good job of laying out the moral cause for disobeying the law. The two situation aren't the same of course, but there is a admiration for King's obvious willingness to break the law, an admiration that is a mixed bag in Snowden's case.<br />
<br />
Since Snowden wasn't in the military, he would not have been held in a military prison, so the Manning comparison isn't complete either. Obviously Snowden would not have been welcomed with open arms in the American judicial system, but I do wonder if he would have had more leverage on political and public opinion level if he had turned himself in. Everyone loves a David would he's personally going up again Goliath, not such when David is giving him the finger from that hill over yonder. <br />

<br />
Yes, as mentioned earlier, the situations are not the same. MLK was living under legally enforced and morally wrong second class citizenship where jail time, beatings and even murder of black people for any or no reason was pretty much a-ok. <br />
<br />
Edward Snowden was not living under such conditions. Quite the opposite. So the idea that he absolutely had to leave the country and seek asylum elsewhere is not an understandable one to me. That doesn't mean he was necessarily wrong to leave the country, but it does sound odd. Particularly when he's seeking asylum in places that do no have historically better record on human rights violations.<br />
<br />
He's working with Wikileaks, who could definitely keep up the release of information or public awareness. There are various internet ways of keeping the message alive, ala Twitter and the like. He supposedly has several important files stashed with friends in case anything happens to him. Sure, no one <em>wants</em> to go to prison, but I've been thinking that the willingness to do so gives a powerful moral weight to his cause that is almost unassailable. <br />
<br />
Compare these two lines of thought: <br />
&quot;The US government is doing something terrible things and despite any previous oaths, I'm willing to bring light to those wrongdoings and accept the consequences of technically breaking the law. It's that important, this is so morally repugnant and against American ideas that not just my life but any future possibilities that life might have had, with skills and high salary, I'm ready to give up because this terrible program is that bad and needs to be stopped.&quot; <br />
<br />
vs<br />
<br />
&quot;The US government is doing something bad, so I'm going to release secrets about that wrongdoing after the leaving the country and trying to avoid capture, will getting into pissing matches about who said what with the President, as I hole up in a Russian airport seeking asylum from seemingly any country that'll take me&quot;<br />
<br />
The former demands respect, even if  you don't agree with the actions, but you have to admire the person for standing their ground. The latter rings hollow and takes the focus of the issue elsewhere. <br />
<br />
Again, these are just idle thoughts of mine and Snowden may be playing some long game that I can't see. But his actions and purported statements do come off as oddly counterproductive. <br />
<br />
<br />
<em>So, can we conclude that when Obama says he's not going to do something, that's the way he tells us what he's definitely going to do?

No, it's just being spun. Read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/03/edward-snowden-asylum-live">The Guardian</a>'s coverage, which was apparently written by a journalist. <em>The Atlantic</em>'s refutations include this acute analysis: <em>&quot;The claim: The plane was searched. [...] According to The New York Times, permission to do so was granted by the Bolivians.&quot;</em><br />
<br />
Well, that certainly dismantles Bolivia's claim! Elsewhere we learn that Portugal didn't deny use of its airspace; it just refused to let the plane make a refueling stop. Bolivia's planes, you know, run on water and &quot;marching powder&quot;; it's entirely natural to deny the right to purchase fuel and it wouldn't at all be because the US State Department was leaning on the Portuguese government. <br />
<br />
You know, if Philip Burr were a journalist, rather than an assiduous asslicker, he might have mentioned that a spokesperson for the US State Department confirmed that it <em>had</em> &quot;been in contact with a range of countries that had a chance of having Snowden land or travel through their country&quot;. She <em>also</em> refused to &quot;confirm or deny any specific involvement with Morale's flight &quot;. But then Philip Burr's ambition is to be the sidekick who pipes up &quot;Yeah, boss!&quot; in a gangster movie: he certainly isn't there to impugn weasel-worded communiques that confirm the US government's narrative.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/40518" target="_self">Joe in Australia</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5071178" target="_self">5:23 PM</a>  on July 3, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5071178" style="font-weight:normal;" title="10 users marked this as favorite">10 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

That's at the real heart of this issue for me.  We, being the humans we predictably are, will always desire to make things &quot;bigger and better&quot; and improve upon existing designs whether through science, law, or general infrastructure planning.   <br />
<br />
How long will it be before this data slides into the realm of general law enforcement via court orders?  All it took were a few orders to get thus far.  How many orders with political misdirections would it take to take it to the next new and improved stage?  Using it to confront drug trafficking, child porn, or money laundering would be obvious segways.  &quot;Don't worry, we're only going after those people...we're building a better, safer future together....oh by the way, we need to reduce FISA requirements a little more, all that paperwork is still slowing us down...&quot;<br />
<br />
I suppose ultimately I'm fearing a possible dystopian future where the water gets unacceptably murky, and we can do little then about it as citizens.  We humans are not only predictable when it comes to improving and expanding on things...we're also predictably bad utilizing those improvements properly when incompetence and special interest creeps in.   The data warehousing operation that once started with the NSA soley to combat international terrorism may  grow to become the ultimate resource for preventing future crimes, and bringing justice on past crimes that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.  As utopic as that may sound to law enforcement, it's obviously Orwellian at its very core, and is in serious danger of being misused/abused at great cost to people who get erroneously, mistakenly, or unfortunately stuck in the system.   For the unfortunate examples, think less of cases where there is clear and present physical danger, and think more about the <a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2013/05/23/a-methuen-teens-rap-lyrics-have-kept-him-in-jail-for-three-weeks/">people</a> who make <a href="http://www.dailyastorian.com/free/facebook-post-lands-astoria-man-in-jail/article_f7f0ddf6-55d6-11e2-b3d7-0019bb2963f4.html">unfortunate decisions</a> with what they <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/08/april-jones-matthew-woods-jailed">write</a> when <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/07/teenager-jailed-for-facebook-comment.html">expressing themselves</a>....especially when young and stupid (we've all been there and most of us turned out fine)...these examples in particular, while not (yet) being related to data warehousing, are just kids faced with a devastating way to ruin one's life and employability just starting out....for now, it's only about what's being actively looked at, and where the public's concerns are perceived to be....using the above examples as the new standard, I hope most people realize that just listening in on Xbox Live chat for a day could imprison half this nation's youth.   Even with known mishaps, abuses, and unintentional suffering at this point, a data warehouse and infrastructure built around collecting all communications could grow to a law enforcement operation that would be too big to fail, and too fundamentally &quot;important&quot; to dismantle.   I unfortunately feel that in secret it has already reached this point of no return just being an anti-terrorism initiative...<br />
<br />
So I think it's important to keep expressing our concerns about this kind of technology with unyielding focus, regardless of what happens with Snowden, whether on his own volition or via various special interests employed by participating countries vying to set the current tone of global politics.  And of course I'll risk ending this comment with conspiracy theory (sadly tinfoil hat aside)...as who knows if his laptops have been compromised at this point, or if his life is in immediate danger, or even if he still alive since his last video interview...anything he writes until his next video interview should be met with keen skepticism....I fear if he is taken out publicly, is jailed, or mysteriously disappears (or all three, with the last option helping us forget him faster) our nation's outrage is only temporary...and the genuine protesters will get marginalized and lumped in with nation crackpots...much of this is the result of basic psychological ops (nothing too fancy as our media culture takes care of a lot for PsyOps these days...well considering I can't really tell if the egg or chicken came first there).   For PsyOps, we have employed personnel in this country easily since the turn of last century (and worldwide for other countries predating Sun Tzu)...we shouldn't expect these individuals to be sitting on their laurels in office chairs, when it comes to shaping the stories of how people feel about governments, and how governments really operate.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/3202" target="_self">samsara</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5076476" target="_self">8:06 AM</a>  on July 8, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5076476" style="font-weight:normal;" title="4 users marked this as favorite">4 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

It's not just the NSA, <a href="http://www.emptywheel.net/2013/07/08/fisc-opinions-as-legal-cover/">in 2006</a> the FISC legalized Cheney's <b>illegal</b> surveillance program:
<blockquote>

&quot;It wasn’t seen that we’re pushing the boundaries of surveillance law here,&quot; Mr. Edgar says. &quot;It was the very opposite. You’re starting from a huge amount of unilateral surveillance and putting it on a much sounder legal basis.&quot;<br />
</blockquote>

They're just doing whatever they want and constructing legal scams to cow the populace. Don't have the surveillance powers you want? Do it anyway. People find out? Browbeat the judges on your fake court to go along with it. Not only that, but this is Obama's baby.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/35452" target="_self">rhizome</a> at <a href="/128901/I-do-not-expect-to-see-home-again#5076620" target="_self">9:40 AM</a>  on July 8, 2013 [<a href="/favorited/2/5076620" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br />
1. The CIA’s “enhanced interrogation techniques” were not effective.<br />

<blockquote>

One of the enduring questions surrounding the torture and black-sites program run by the CIA between early 2002 and the early fall of 2006 relates to the role played by psychologists and the bizarre conduct of their professional association, the American Psychological Association (APA). Drawing on a cache of secret email communications between key players in the torture program and senior officers of the APA, Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter James Risen suggests in Pay Any Price, his new book, that the APA rushed to change its ethics rules to allow its members to participate in the torture program.<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
I believe the APA’s collaboration with the CIA regarding the Bush-era interrogation program will eventually be recognized as one of the greatest scandals in the history of American medical ethics.<br />

Don't worry, that's the narrative that's already being pushed by Conservatives and Republicans.

<a name="5849163"></a><div class="comments">I've never been a huge Feinstein fan, she's far too conservative and corporatist, but she did a good thing here and by all reports she did it against the active opposition of Obama and his staff.  That takes some serious guts, and I hope she doesn't pay too high a political price for that.<br />
<br />
And no, for those of us in the reality based community the report contains nothing really new except that finally the US government is (very reluctantly) admitting that those things happened.  But most Americans never got more than a CIA flack on the news agreeing with the talking head from the cocktail circuit that the &quot;enhanced interrogations&quot; were nothing really severe and utterly necessary to save us from the evil terrorists.<br />
<br />
Now, perhaps, a few of the less politically involved people will become aware of the truth.<br />
<br />
Hoping that this will result in Obama changing course and actually prosecuting the evil people who committed crimes against humanity basically because they felt like it is pure foolishness.  Obama told us early on that he would never even investigate, much less prosecute, the criminals of the Bush II administration, and therefore he all but guaranteed that when the next Republican president is in office they'll torture more, and they'll use more horrible techniques, and they'll expand the program as much as they can.<br />
<br />
But perhaps, now that there's also the assurance that at least a tiny bit of light will be shed on the torturers then they may hold back a bit.<br />
<br />
And it is unutterably depressing that at the moment the highest hope I have for my nation is that, perhaps, maybe, possibly, this heavily redacted report might shame a few of the torturers from not being quite so bad.  But realistically that's all I can hope for.  Assuming she wins, President Clinton is likely to be even more pro-torture than Obama is, and any Republican will be vastly worse.<br />

Sure. There's all of social psychology, which consistently shows that confirmation bias, cognitive dissonance, groupthink, tribalism, and many other truth-distorting mental phenomena creep in when you have people with strong ideological affiliations investigating something. <br />
<br />
There's also all of common sense, which says that political staffers actually care about politics and might want to make things look as bad as they possibly can for the opposition, and conceal any countervailing points or nuances as much as possible -- and doubly so a year before a presidential election.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/19597" target="_self">shivohum</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849165" target="_self">10:04 AM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5849165" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Arguing that torture “damaged our security interests as well as our reputation as a force for good in the world,” Mr. McCain said that the American people had a right to know what was being done in their name.<br />

Here, from page 33 of the Report, is the language establishing the above:
<blockquote>...drafted a letter to Attorney General John Ashcroft asking the Department of Justice for &quot;a formal declination of prosecution, in advance, for any employees of the United States, as well as any other personnel acting on behalf of the United States, who may employ methods in the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah that otherwise might subject those individuals to prosecution. The letter further indicated that &quot;the interrogation team had concluded &quot;that &quot;the use of more aggressive methods is required to persuade Abu Zubaydah to provide the critical information we need to safeguard the lives of innumerable innocent men, women and children within the United States and abroad.&quot; The letter added that these &quot;aggressive methods&quot; would otherwise be prohibited by the torture statute, &quot;apart from potential reliance upon the doctrines of necessity or of self-defense.&quot;<br />

You can say it is ineffective, and it is for the stated purposes. The real purpose is the venting and rage against the stupidity and danger of the blood sport to low level players, that eventually becomea a mode of fetish release of fear, and grief over loss.

<a name="5849319"></a><div class="comments">Savage men feel burdened by the injunctions of polite society not to openly brutalize others.  In secret, however, their unshakeable conviction that morality is merely a speed-bump on the path to power and victory can find full expression, if they are not already in open, total war.  Even when their sadism and violence has no obvious use, no empirical outcome aside from the visible suffering of their victims, they persist, because they have given themselves over to the idea of bare power completely.  In their minds, there is no problem that cannot be solved by hurting someone else, and if the problem is not yet solved, it is because someone has not suffered enough yet.<br />
<br />
This mentality is, not coincidentally, central to the American social order.  America is founded upon not only a practice of everyday violence, but a normalization of the willingness to commit and tolerate that violence.  Indeed, America would be unimaginable without it.  <br />
<br />
Before there is violence, there is often a process of steeling oneself, or consciously working to build solidarity with other would-be killers in the course of turning off the natural empathic reaction that people have to others who are suffering.  But when violence is inscribed in the practices and institutions of civil life to such a degree as exists in America, with its ethnic conception of personhood, a generalized deadening of empathy begins to have bizarre and toxic consequences.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/18296" target="_self">clockzero</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849319" target="_self">10:58 AM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5849319" style="font-weight:normal;" title="34 users marked this as favorite">34 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Mark Udall had previously <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/12/09/senate-unveils-cia-torture-report-udall-calls-release-victory/115650/">threatened to begin reading the report on the floor of the Senate</a>, adding:
<blockquote>

&quot;I'm not going to accept the release of any version of the executive summary that doesn't get out the truth of this program,&quot; Udall told the Post. &quot;Not only do we have to shed light on this dark chapter of our nation's history, but we've got to make sure future administrations don't repeat the grave mistakes.&quot;<br />

Today, it <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/12/09/senate-unveils-cia-torture-report-udall-calls-release-victory/115650/">sounds like he's declaring victory</a>, even though the full report hasn't been released:
<blockquote>

&quot;The release of the executive summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee's study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program is an historic victory for our nation, the Constitution, and our system of checks and balances,&quot; he said in a statement. <br />
</blockquote>

So, either enough detail was added to the executive summary that Udall feels the important stuff is in there, or he's subtly moving the goalposts so that he's not on the hook to begin reading the full report on the floor.  Hopefully someone asks him directly why he won't push harder for the release of all 6,000 pages.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/98355" target="_self">tonycpsu</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849327" target="_self">11:00 AM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5849327" style="font-weight:normal;" title="13 users marked this as favorite">13 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Yes, because hanging someone from the ceiling in a diaper, forcing them to defecate on themselves, is justifiable.  Because stripping someone practically naked and chaining them to a stone wall in winter and they die from hypothermia is justifiable.  Because locking people up in kennels for months without even talking to them in foreign secret countries is justifiable.  Because rectally feeding and hydrating people against their will is...well, you get the point.<br />
<br />
The fact that conservatives are making this a partisan issue is a prime example of the virulent political disease that's infected American politics since the mid to late 90s.  The GOP, the party of &quot;patriots&quot; leap over themselves to defend acts that are unilaterally unAmerican (are they still?) and to thrust into the shadows the attempt to reveal these acts, because a free society should not be given the freedom to know what their government is up to.   <br />
<br />
Can we create a memorial on the Mall in DC for these acts?  List the names of the victims and the names of perpetrators, and allow future Americans and global visitors see it and ask themselves, &quot;Is this here to remind us not to do it again or is it here to gloat?&quot; <br />
<br />
The only glimmer of light in the report is the fact that CIA officers on the ground, some, at least, saw what they had been ordered to do and done and recognized the evil that had been performed by their hands and asked to be allowed to stop.  Conversely, those who did not have blood on their hands, the ones in offices not too far from their homes, refused this request and ordered them to continue.  It's the inhumanity of bureaucracy.<br />

Yeah, seems like it.  The thing is, what IS an intelligence agency?  If it's just spying, fine.  Keep and eye on other countries to protect your interests, maybe using some tactics that are on ethical and legal borderlines, fine.<br />
<br />
But these agencies are not doing that, they are engaged in interventionist foreign policy. It's not intelligence gathering to stage a coup or prop up a revolution or support a side in a civil war.  It's not intelligence gathering to smuggle drugs.  It's not intelligence gathering to harbor the most wanted terrorist in the world.  It's not intelligence gathering to torture innocent people to death.<br />
<br />
This is foriegn policy executed with little regard for the voters or leaders in Democratic nations and often even by rogue agencies with little regard for the leaders in otherwise autocratic nations.  They need to be held to some sort of account, if the USA can't do it...we're doomed if we expect Pakistan or Saudi Arabia or Russia to do it.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/166808" target="_self">Drinky Die</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849366" target="_self">11:18 AM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5849366" style="font-weight:normal;" title="8 users marked this as favorite">8 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br />
What possible 'nuance' or 'countervailing points' are there when we are discussing <i>torture</i>?<br />
<br />
<i> You want to establish that torture is illegal? How about having trials, verdicts, and sentences!? You don't establish SHIT by pardons.</i><br />
<br />
As I understand it, the act of issuing a pardon would <i>de facto</i> establish that something needed to be pardoned in the first place, thus defining the pardoned-for acts as illegal.<br />
<br />
<i>The statute of limitations ran out? Have a trial anyway! If our government is going to break the law, can we at least break the law to hold accountable those responsible for actual heinous evil shit, instead of only breaking it to perpetuate it?</i><br />
<br />
Breaking the law to uphold the rule of law against those who broke the law is kind of turtles all the way down. At some point you have to go &quot;Okay, we cannot do anything about that, but we are going to make sure something can be done in the future.&quot;<br />

The fact that various government agencies and officials lied, that &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; never produced any significant intelligence or prevented further attacks -- none of that matters. Even if one could demonstrate unequivocally that torture actually <em>harms</em> US interests, a huge number of people would not care one whit because for them this is about <em>revenge</em>.

It taps into the worst aspects of human nature, the violent, animalistic tribalism that has no concern for questions of right or wrong. That it is so widespread in this country (and, no doubt, many others), that it can so easily engulf even ostensibly &quot;liberal&quot; people, that it can be given a veneer of respectability and rationality by the media and our government and pursued as <em>fucking state policy</em> makes me weep for the future of human &quot;civilization.&quot;<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/71654" target="_self">Saxon Kane</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849379" target="_self">11:23 AM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5849379" style="font-weight:normal;" title="67 users marked this as favorite">67 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

I think both clockzero and Saxon Kane have the right of it.  For a large number of Americans, quite likely a firm majority, torture is desirable.  They want it.  They want vengeance wreaked in their name, they don't even particularly care if the people being tortured for their vengeance are guilty of anything, simple membership in the wrong tribe is enough for many of our fellow citizens to feel that the victim deserves it.<br />

Exactly. The &quot;brilliance&quot; of the Bush-Cheney regime, as with many regimes before it, was to tap into the worst elements of the population, inflame them, and then use that to power their agenda. It was about capturing human brutality and directing it in a way that would push forward the neocon agenda. Incidents like Abu Ghraib are a natural consequence of this sort of hate-mongering, and really, the bosses in charge don't need to worry all that much about the eventual truth getting out because enough of the viewers at home get a vicarious thrill by seeing their own power fantasies getting played out.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/71654" target="_self">Saxon Kane</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849411" target="_self">11:37 AM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5849411" style="font-weight:normal;" title="6 users marked this as favorite">6 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

The people of America actively and deliberately love torture, it happens for the same reason why the police are actively racist in their enforcement of the law, why America keeps building and filling prisons, and why the wealthy are largely free from taxation and the poor forced to pay for all of the above: most Americans want it that way.<br />

Your argument might make sense if there was some reluctance, or if America was actually getting mob wife benefits.  But neither is the case.

<a name="5849478"></a><div class="comments">I always figure that a lot of people think torture sounds fun - to perpetrate, not to endure.  I think a lot of the people who commit torture enjoy it.  I think that's why, at root, it's so difficult to stop people - because the kind of moral thinking that you need to do in order not to get a kick out of hurting others is relatively rare and substantially discouraged.   I've been around enough cops as they beat people to be pretty confident that they thought it was fun as long as it wasn't too much work; I see no reason that torturers would be any different.  The key part is that everyone involved can <i>pretend</i> they aren't having fun - that there's some higher force compelling them, that they are just following orders.  <br />

...Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), then the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, appeared on CNN’s “Late Edition” on March 2, 2003. Rockefeller, who had been extensively briefed about the CIA’s efforts, told Wolf Blitzer that “happily, we don’t know where [KSM] is,” adding: “He’s in safekeeping, under American protection. He’ll be grilled by us. I’m sure we’ll be proper with him, but I’m sure we’ll be very, very tough with him.”<br />

...When Blitzer asked about how KSM would be interrogated, Rockefeller assured him that “there are presidential memorandums that prescribe and allow certain measures to be taken, but we have to be careful.” Then he added: “On the other hand, he does have the information. Getting that information will save American lives. We have no business not getting that information.”<br />

Perhaps, but republican's quote said nothing of the sort. It talked only of kidnapping, so as a gotcha it's kind of a total fail. <br />
<br />
<i>With rendition you can pretty much assume that they are being tortured too.</i><br />
<br />
Under the definition of rendition as popularized by the Bush administration, sure. The quote talked about kidnapping, not kidnapping and sending to a prison in a country with lax legal protections so they could have their fingernails torn out.<br />

They love this activity, they are remorseless, despicable, and posessed of nearly infinite resources to play the game. By now four generations of players have profited and enjoyed this game of absolute power, and the chaos it creates.

Now the soldiers are home for Christmas if they are lucky. There is a huge silence created by the visible strain to the tattered fabric of their spirits told in tortured looks.

I've been thinking abaout this a lot recently; I just started reading Hobsbawm's <em>Age of Extremes</em>, and a point he makes several times in the first bit of the book is an assertion that the moral quality of civilization declined precipitously over the course of the 20th century. He sees evidence this mainly in the way wars were conducted in the 20th vs 19th century, and at first I was ready to dismiss it as an artifact of his being a 19th century historian, but the more I think about it I think there really is something to it -- that amoral individuality is encouraged in our society in a way that seems specifically designed to undermine Enlightenment ideals about the role of civil society and government, and an individual's responsibilities to the welfare of others.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/154262" target="_self">junco</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849667" target="_self">1:27 PM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5849667" style="font-weight:normal;" title="6 users marked this as favorite">6 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Yes but what if the alternative was WORSE -- do you not comprehend how that works?

<a name="5849733"></a><div class="comments"><em>The point is to correct a lot of misinformation.</em><br />
<br />
Since I haven't read any actual examples of bias or misinformation here, I took it upon myself to read some of the Republican response to the report, and to evaluate some of the claims it made. For example, on page 13, they allege that Abu Zubaydah provided &quot;actionable intelligence&quot; <em>after</em> being tortured, and they state that this was responsible for disrupting a plot against Americans in Karachi. Let's look at exactly what they claim happened:
<blockquote>This information caused Pakistani [redacted] authorities to intensify their efforts and helped lead them to arrest [certain terrorists].</blockquote>

Do you hear that? The Pakistani authorities <em>intensified their efforts</em>! Oh my! The Republican report cites as its source a CIA document from 2002.<br />
<br />
However, footnote 1369 on page 242 of the SSCI (&quot;Democrat&quot;) Report disputes this claim. The SSCI report cites as its source a June 2013 response to the Senate investigation, and summarizes it thusly:
<blockquote>The CIA does not dispute that ... information from the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program played no role in the arrests.</blockquote>

The CIA also conceded in their response (and this is a literal quote) that they &quot;mischaracterized the impact of the reporting [the CIA] acquired from detainees on the Karachi plots.&quot; Presumably some of that mischaracterization was done in the 2002 document cited in the Republican response.<br />
<br />
Do Republicans really want to defend the utility of torture? If so, they should push for the entire report and its sources to be declassified. In so doing, we could better understand what happened and why.<br />
<br />
If this partisan bickering were anything more than a distraction from the actual issues — people were tortured, and it was horrible, and it gained us nothing — participants in this thread would bring forward actual examples of misinformation and bias in the report itself.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/142099" target="_self">compartment</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849733" target="_self">1:57 PM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5849733" style="font-weight:normal;" title="7 users marked this as favorite">7 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Yeah, so if that little masturbatory fantasy ever happens in real life, and the officer on the scene is so sure it's true that he's willing to commit torture, then he's welcome to take that moral burden on himself and beat the information out of the guy, and if he's so sure he's right he can be confident he'll recieve a Presidential pardon for it.

I find it funny that the common scenario for torture apologists is &quot;it's ok to totally torture that guy as long as it saves a life&quot;. Do you lot have an actual example? Was the person being saved ok with that choice? Why do you apologist still decide to label torture in such a scenario as moral?<br />
<br />
 In my younger years, I lived in a country that was ruled by a series or ruthless military dictators. I have witnessed bloody military coups, people being shot and burned alive for all sorts of reasons.  One thing I have come to learn about people who commit and permit all sorts of immoral acts is how willing they are to believe in the nobility of their cause. How willing they are to invoke a bogeyman to justify the terrible things they do.

Because the original point was about bias, about the story that was being told.<br />
<br />
Torture is terrible, but it's certainly on a continuum with killing and maiming civilians in war, and few people suggest that all wars are unjust because, for example, innocent children are going to be killed in them.<br />
<br />
And of course most terrorists are very far from innocent children.<br />
<br />
If you don't believe that knowingly hurting people in order to protect other people is sometimes an unavoidable part of a government's duty, then that makes you an absolute pacifist. And hey, that's a respectable position, but it's also very much a minority position, and there are no developed countries that agree.<br />
<br />
I think this &quot;torture is something special, something <em>so</em> different, something <em>so</em> much worse, than other things that societies do all the time to protect themselves&quot; is largely rationalization and self-delusion, a protection against seeing all the monstrous things that countries do all the time to survive.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/19597" target="_self">shivohum</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849783" target="_self">2:17 PM</a>  on December 9 </span></div><br><br>

    The “cold bath” technique – the same as that used against al-Qahtani in Guantanamo – was, according to professor Darius Rejali of Reed College, “pioneered by a member of the French Gestapo by the pseudonym Masuy about 1943. The Belgian resistance referred to it as the Paris method, and the Gestapo authorized its extension from France to at least two places late in the war, Norway and Czechoslovakia. That is where people report experiencing it.”<br />

There are at least two correct responses to, &quot;What if it saves lives?&quot; The first response is an ethical one: &quot;I don't care. Nothing justifies that.&quot; Some people choose that response, and I respect them for it.<br />
<br />
The second, and I believe even stronger, response is: &quot;<em>Does</em> it save lives?&quot; The answer to this, even according to the CIA itself, appears to be, &quot;At worst no, at best, we have no idea.&quot; If you have <em>no proof whatsoever</em> (and shivohum has none) that what you are doing is helping at all, and it appears to be disgusting and unethical or immoral to many if not most people and is probably illegal, the correct action to take is to <em>stop doing it</em>. At best it's a waste of money and time, speaking purely pragmatically. At worst it is both that and also counterproductive, because there is no way this stuff is not making us enemies.<br />

You could, in theory, but the actual report in front of us suggests that torture of innocent people did not do a very good job at saving lives. <br />

In fact, Feinstein's report specifically calls out the CIA for misrepresenting the efficacy of its torture program to elected officials. <br />

Whether or not this detail is included in the report to absolve culpability on the part of Bush and Cheney — we can table that question for a moment — this indicates that torture did not, in fact, have the intended effect of bolstering national security.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/209369" target="_self">a lungful of dragon</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849854" target="_self">2:47 PM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5849854" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Your original post suggested possible bias but you were not able to present anything in the way of credible evidence to support that position. You were called out on that by me and a number of other posters so unless you have something new, my criticism stands. Besides, the Washington Post and other news outlets have done a pretty decent job explaining the genesis of this summary report. <br />
<br />
No one in this thread has, at least to my knowledge, written anything remotely coming close to saying all violence is immoral or that all war is bad. What we are talking about here is one thing and one thing alone and that is the sanctioning and use of torture by us. Let's not shift the goal post.  Do you have any examples where any of the acts described in the summary report today saved lives? <br />
We agree that we are in a fight against individuals and groups with no moral hangups about murder and destruction.  There are many ways to fight terrorism and protect a country and its inhabitants. I just don't believe that rectal feeding or threatening rape and murder of someone's mother or knowingly detaining and torturing up to 26 innocent people or having people die through hypothermia is one of those ways.

Page 24 of the CIA memo addresses the SSCI’s conclusion that the “CIA never conducted its own comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of the CIA’s enhanced interrogation techniques.” The CIA’s response:<br />
<br />
    “We agree with Conclusion 10 in full. It underpins the most important lesson that we have drawn from The Study: CIA needs to develop the structure, expertise, and methodologies required to more objectively and systematically evaluate the effectiveness of our covert actions. We draw this lesson going forward fully aware of how difficult it can be to measure the impact of a particular action or set of actions on an outcome in a real-world setting.”<br />

It's an antithesis to American values.  The right against forced self incrimination is foundational in America.  I know the constitution doesn't necessarily apply to some guy we picked up in Afghanistan, but the reasons for which the founders guaranteed themselves that right are the same reasons he deserves it.  We can say we live up to the letter of the law when we strip that right, but not the spirit.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/166808" target="_self">Drinky Die</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849905" target="_self">3:10 PM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5849905" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<a name="5849912"></a><div class="comments">I can very much appreciate the anger at the violation of America's much vaunted &quot;values&quot; that the torture represents, but I think it's a mistake to make it the focus of the argument. It is an emotional argument rather than an evidentiary one, and that is why the torture defenders in this thread have focused on responding to it, because they know they can run around and around it and never get anywhere. You either think torture abrogates America's (fictional, in my opinion, but that doesn't matter here) moral superiority or you think it is justified to &quot;catch the bad guys,&quot; but neither is a matter of fact.<br />
<br />
The evidentiary argument is: there is no evidence that torture actually works to uncover information. The lengths to which desperate people might be driven in some completely contrived and fictional &quot;ticking bomb&quot; scenario are absolutely no basis for considered policy. There is no doubt that any resources of time and money that we devote to torture are resources we could have devoted to more effective means of assuring security and very little doubt that it increases the number and ferocity of our enemies. These arguments have gone without response, and I don't think it's difficult to see why.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/173451" target="_self">Steely-eyed Missile Man</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849912" target="_self">3:16 PM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5849912" style="font-weight:normal;" title="5 users marked this as favorite">5 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

And I responded to that criticism, and unless you have something new to add, I guess you concede the point. See how irritating that sounds?<br />
<br />
Partisan politics plays a role -- for all sorts of quite legitimate, quite real, and quite evidence-based psychological, sociological, and self-interested reasons -- in the narration of the moral <em>story</em> behind why people did what they did. Is it really far-fetched to think that Democrats would automatically tend to assemble information into a story that paints a worse picture of the Bush administration than Republicans would? You don't need a nefarious conspiracy to think this happens. It is second nature for people to think badly of their opponents.<br />
<br />
Can the defense and the prosecution in a trial take the same facts and tell completely different stories? Yes.<br />
<br />
A witness reporting that they are getting a deal in return for their testimony, is, without anything else, considered evidence that the jury can consider in evaluating the credibility of that witness. <br />
<br />
The ideological affiliation of a thinktank is considered completely valid to mention when evaluating, on its face, the objectivity of a report it issues.<br />
<br />
That's what bias is, and it is something well worth keeping in mind when trying to figure out something as murky and subjective as internal decision-making processes of intelligence officials from the outside.

<a name="5849934"></a><div class="comments">phaedon: <i>from a purely philosophical, non-partisan standpoint, you can justify the torturing of innocent people if it saves lives</i><br />
<br />
There is no &quot;pure&quot; philosophical standpoint. For some (Kantians, for example), some acts are always morally forbidden, no matter how much good might flow from doing them. If you think that inherent respect for the humanity of others forbids torturing them, then it doesn't matter how many lives might be saved by resorting to the pliers and hot irons.<br />
<br />
If you're a consequentialist, of course, you can convince yourself you're in the right as long as torture is the lesser evil--that is, as long as it produces that mythical &quot;best outcome&quot;. But notoriously, consequentialism speaks in the devil's tongue, seducing you into thinking that you know who has the crucial piece of information and just how you need to squeeze them to make them talk. &quot;What if...?&quot; is the whisper that erases all doubt. And once you start down that road, the outcomes of that act themselves <i>have</i> to be concealed, again on consequentialist grounds. Isn't that what's behind the bleating of the Republicans who insist that the report will only encourage further attacks? <br />
<br />
Hideous deeds done under a cloak of necessary secrecy: that's the logic of the consequentialist torture apologist. If this is where &quot;pure philosophy&quot; leads us, we should exile it from our minds forever.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/208107" target="_self">informavore</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5849934" target="_self">3:25 PM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5849934" style="font-weight:normal;" title="11 users marked this as favorite">11 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

You mentioned legal philosophy earlier, when positing your hypothetical. Legally, war and torture are subjects distinct enough that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_against_Torture">Geneva Conventions</a> were written to codify the difference and proscribe the latter (in absolute terms: regardless of whether or not a party is at war).

Why do we think that whatever bias might exist only cuts in this direction and along this particular axis?

<br />
This is an important question.  However, the problem of our time is not to ask what war accomplishes, but to ask when it ends, where it ends?  The brutal logic of war as a way of life is deeply embedded in civilian life at this point, and I don't just mean class-based or racially-oriented conflicts, though it appears there too.  The struggle to dominate, and the many subtle and outright assertions of the right that some people believe they have to dominate others, is what distinguishes war from normal life.  Eventually, America has to go back to normal.  Eventually, war has to end, not only as military actions themselves, but as a way of living.  This is why the peace movement was and is so radical: opposing war not just as an external military phenomenon but as an organizing logic of social life itself means undoing lots of oppressive structures which are, more or less, war by other means.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/18296" target="_self">clockzero</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5850021" target="_self">4:05 PM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5850021" style="font-weight:normal;" title="8 users marked this as favorite">8 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<blockquote>

Zenko's own tally, based on reporting from non-governmental research organizations, puts the rough death toll at around 3,500 people. These include an unknown number of civilian casualties believed by independent researchers to number at least in the hundreds; the Obama administration reportedly counts &quot;all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants,&quot; which produces lower estimates of civilian casualties. Tuesday's report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, lists 119 terror suspects known to have been detained by the CIA, of whom &quot;at least 39 were subject to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.&quot; Twenty-six of the total number of detainees, the report continues, should not have been detained in the first place.<br />
<br />
But despite the vast disparity in the numbers of people abused through the CIA's detention program versus killed by drones, there has been no official accounting of the latter program on par with the torture report released this week. &quot;[T]hose normally interested in upholding human rights ideals and promoting transparency (generally Democrats) simply will not investigate their own,&quot; Zenko explained. &quot;And as I've pointed out in every public opinion poll ... Americans are more comfortable killing suspected terrorists than torturing them.&quot;<br />

The framers of the Geneva Convention (to which the US is signatory) were, moreover, determined that all prisoners fall under some provision of international law. René Värk argues:<br />
<br />
“the commentary to Article 45 (3) asserts that ‘a person of enemy nationality who is not entitled to prisoner-of-war status is, in principle, a civilian protected by the Fourth Convention, so that there are no gaps in protection’.*32 But, at the same time, it also observes that things are not always so straightforward in armed conflicts; for example, adversaries can have the same nationality, which renders the application of the Fourth Convention impossible, and there can arise numerous difficulties regarding the application of that convention. Thus, as the Fourth Convention is a safety net to persons who do not qualify for protection under the other three Geneva Conventions, Article 45 (3) serves yet again as a safety net for those who do not benefit from more favourable treatment in accordance with the Fourth Convention.”<br />
<br />

<a name="5850127"></a><div class="comments">Yikes - way too much to read so quickly, so I don't know if this has been brought up or not:<br />
<br />
Isn't it amazing how this can of worms was opened up right at the time when we need to get attention redirected from Ferguson and police brutality to something else - <em>anything else</em>? It has to be something BIG, though, because the protests are getting pretty BIG themselves. Yes, this should do it...<br />
<br />
Also, was there an actual time when President Obama <em>could have</em> had Bush and Co. charged and prosecuted for war crimes - without the support of Congress? Could he really do that all by himself? <br />
<br />
I think that when Obama took office the first time this country was reeling from economic collapse and war-induced shock and his platform and his goals were to get the country back on its feet and moving forward as soon as he possibly could. He was determined to be as bipartisan as possible (which turned out to be a big mistake), he knew that a huge percentage of Americans were dead-set against anything he wanted to do because he was BLACK, for God's sake! So he walked into office with so many strikes against him, so many disasters still unfolding - if he had actually tried to charge and prosecute the Dimestore Cowboy Dubya and Evil Dick The Heart Patient, and Mr. Military Rumsfeld and WOMAN of His Own Black Race Condi, the country would have exploded - or imploded. He would have been able to accomplish absolutely nothing in the rest of his presidency because that whole procedure would have taken ALL the time and energy and money and resources available - and, significantly, he knew it would never ever have resulted in even one of those bad clowns spending a weekend in jail. Not a chance. <br />
<br />
So, he very wisely passed on the whole deal, determined to put his work and resources into play in a way that would benefit the country the most, knowing that karma would keep the Bush Bunch busy on its own. Also, there was pretty good evidence that Dubya himself was in the early stages of dementia and Cheney was on his last legs with one heart failure after another, which would have been the core of each defense - again, going nowhere. <br />
<br />
Equating Obama's position in this with that of Bush/Cheney/Rummy/Ashcroft/Rice is preposterous, but there will be many, now that the CIA report has been released, who will squawk that the whole country is behind torture and &quot;Americans&quot; are a piece of work and yadda yadda ... Anytime &quot;Americans&quot; are slammed as one unit I just chalk the writer up as someone who's stupid in the first place and just really wants to fight. This is a BIG country and there are so many different kinds of Americans I couldn't box and label them if I tried - neither can anyone else. The media does a pretty good job, though.<br />
<br />
I still think that what we want to watch out for is the distraction this CIA report provides to the still-very-critical issue of police brutality - which seems to truly affect ALL the land called America.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/130108" target="_self">aryma</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5850127" target="_self">4:57 PM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5850127" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

The US is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-released-senate">legally required</a> to bring the torturers and their chain of command to justice.
<blockquote>International law prohibits the granting of immunities to public officials who have engaged in acts of torture. This applies not only to the actual perpetrators but also to those senior officials within the US Government who devised, planned and authorised these crimes.<br />
<br />
As a matter of international law, the US is legally obliged to bring those responsible to justice. The UN Convention Against Torture and the UN Convention on Enforced Disappearances require States to prosecute acts of torture and enforced disappearance where there is sufficient evidence to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction.

Call and write your congressperson and demand that something be done.  Let them sort out what.<br />
<br />
I know that seems like small beer.  But the problem is, because it seems like such small beer, so very many people don't do that.  And by doing so, we abdicate control of our congress to the very few people who have the money sufficient to bribe congress to THEIR interests.<br />
<br />
Imagine what would happen, though, if we suddenly all started angrily calling our congressional representatives and - daily, if necessary - asking them what they were going to do to rectify this.  Letting them know just how disappointed we are in the government, and reminding them that we'll be carrying that disappointment to the voting booth in the next election.<br />
<br />
It's a long slow slog of a thing, and it won't work unless nearly everyone else in the country follows suit.  But it's also the very reason we have a participatory government - so we can speak out about things like this TO the people in charge.  Our problems don't stem from the congressmen wholly - they also stem from the fact that the vast majority of us simply don't use the power we do have as often as we should.  I'm gonna be having a tense conversation with PaterCallipygos over the holidays - he recently said that he'd probably vote for Jeb Bush during the next election solely because he doesn't like Hilary Clinton, and I'mma ask him &quot;dude, why not vote in the fucking primary so she doesn't get to be the candidate in the first place?&quot; Because I bet you that he wasn't planning on voting in the primary, just like a fuck-ton of other people won't be, and that's how the candidates you don't like get in.<br />

Obama makes a point in today’s statement to say he formally ended “one element of our nation’s response to 9/11 — the CIA’s detention and interrogation program,” but by making sure to specify, he is specifically leaving the door open on other actions permitted under findings generated by the Bush OLC. It is well and good that Obama “will continue to use [his] authority as President to make sure we never resort to those [torture] methods again,” but being a little bit moral is about as plausible as being a little bit pregnant.

Rectal hydration, also know as a Murphy drip, was commonly used in the early 1900s, before intravenous hydration was developed. It works, but given the ready availability of safe IV fluids now, there's little reason to use it except for end-of-life comfort care when IV access is unavailable and oral intake is impossible. Obviously comfort was not a concern in CIA torture facilities.<br />

A certain proportion of the population are meatheads, or, if not meatheads, either adherent to various ideologies that glorify or enable meatheadedness or people who enjoy power and find the exploitation of meatheadedness to be a useful expedient.  Our society seems overly prone to elevating all of these types of people to positions where their meathead-nature has fairly free rein to manifest itself.  Torture abroad, and police brutality at home (also large amounts of straight-up torture at home), are both direct results of a culture that nurtures, rather than dampens, human tendencies toward inappropriate violence, and abuse of power, and these problems should be discussed in tandem, as symptoms of a common rot.<br />

<a name="5850297"></a><div class="comments"><em>The vastly-redacted Senate report has raised another issue. Crudely, these are crimes. In anyone's version of law, international and foreign, the treatment of prisoners - nowhere denied - is beyond the pale. Simply to remind the world that terrorists don't care about due process won't do. Torture was allowed, endorsed, &quot;indicated&quot;, indulged and accepted. Nothing in American or English law, civil or military, allows that.<br />
<br />
Arrests then? But who are we kidding? One of the dullest jokes in the free western world rests on the fact that Mr Bush, Tony Blair and all the rest will never face interrogation, far less a risk to liberty, for debauching democracy. The worms are a sight bigger than the can. Being &quot;held to a higher standard&quot; has come to mean not being held to any standard. Among struggling countries, this is noticed.<br />
<br />
The fact remains: we - or our friends and allies - did not hesitate for an instant over the use of torture. The essence of the argument is surely that we offer something better than the nihilism of terrorism and suicide belts. We don't behead people. We don't threaten their children. We don't tell them how they must think and feel. We don't bully. We believe in rights.<br />
<br />
When legal action is brought in the US and UK against the agents of torture, I might manage another noble paragraph. The great corruption embraced by Mr Bush and his kind was exactly this. This was what they seemed always to want. Finding an enemy with a face, hurting that enemy, eradicating that enemy, seemed to matter more than the obvious: &quot;How come we would up with so many enemies?&quot;<br />
<br />
The US did not not earn its woes. Little Britain's empire is long gone. But if we engage in or indulge torture we are not entitled - legally or morally - to set any of the rules. That's a problem. For America, it's a bigger deal than America yet seems to grasp.</em> <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/columnists/defend-torture-and-you-have-lost-the-argument.114304638">HeraldScotland Opinion</a><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/23476" target="_self">infini</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5850297" target="_self">6:46 PM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5850297" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

It is, however, instructive to see the state sanctioned murders of Brown and Garner side by side with the state sanctioned torture and murder of countless innocents in the War on Being Scared. The United States is racist, imperialist, and it kills and steals with impunity abroad just as much as it does right here. The two are definitely connected, and not just in the sense that the American police are given cheap and easy access to military weaponry. They're connected in spirit.

Propaganda IS insidious because 24 is more than an &quot;argument&quot; for torture. Like police dramas, it gives a rich inner life to people who commit acts of brutality with a clear conscience. So it's not just Middle America being rubes, it's cosmopolitan liberals like Nick Kristof feeling the urge to point out <a href="https://twitter.com/NickKristof/status/542354629443719169">CIA officers were in tears</a> (and inevitably someone argues that this sense of regret is what separates us from the people we torture)<br />

I didn't see the CNN piece, just the tweet.  I don't know if I can clarify any better than what is already there. It appears Baer said that at least some people in the CIA pushed back against the &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; plan, but it was being pushed from 'the top.'

We did not go to Saudi Arabia to punish them for 9/11. We went to another country, causing the deaths of nearly a million people. This torture comes on top of failure to catch 9/11. The torture just ups the ante for the next big thing. The blood sport is on, the profits, bigger than a daily Super Bowl. <br />

Torture is a sadstic sexual activity that is a perk of warring for expert, paid sadists, and a nightmare for regular humans who get the assignment. <br />

One of the most encouraging moments I had today was when I read <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-cia-torture-report-20141209-story.html#page=2">this passage</a>:
<blockquote>In a CIA report of that meeting, Bush was described as “uncomfortable” with the description of a detainee chained to the ceiling and left to defecate on himself.</blockquote>

That discomfort is a little glimmer of hope. I think that most people, even if they are not deeply saddened by what happened, they are at least discomforted. It's easy to say, &quot;It's okay if it saves lives.&quot; It's more difficult to say, &quot;It's okay to chain a man to the ceiling, and leave him to defecate on himself, if it saves lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that is why videotape recordings of torture sessions were destroyed. That is why there is this long-winded, utterly pointless, head-fake argument of &quot;actually, it's about ethics in Senate Intelligence Committee investigations.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, it's about what was done in the name of our security. If you want to argue that &quot;it's okay if it saves lives,&quot; we need to talk about the truth value of that proposition. There are two halves to that: Did &quot;it&quot; actually save lives?

On the other side were James E. Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, two former military psychologists who had advised the agency to use waterboarding and other coercive methods. With the support of C.I.A. headquarters, they insisted that Mr. Nashiri and other prisoners were still withholding crucial information, and that the application of sufficient pain and disorientation would eventually force them to disclose it. They thought the other faction was “running a ‘sissified’ interrogation program,” the report says.<br />

My point was -- pretty damn obviously -- not about trials, but about a desire to interview the obviously relevant parties before making a decision about the truth. That principle is embodied in the way trials are conducted, but it's hardly exclusive to them.<br />
<br />
Journalists, for example, are under the same obligation. Suppose an accusation is made against a company. Would it be ethical for the journalists to make a giant report on how the accusations are true without interviewing anyone at the company? Wouldn't any such report be rightly regarded as garbage, or even a motivated hit job?<br />

Why not? You may say these men are liars but why not interview them, and then disprove their statements if necessary? Maybe because it would bring up inconvenient information.<br />

Even though many of us are jaded and cynical, do you lot think we don't actually pay attention? This report has been fought against tooth and nail by the White House and DoJ currently occupied by a Democrat. The outgoing Chair of the Select Committee practically carried the IC's water. Feinstein was a fierce advocate for the IC like no other. Yet, I'm supposed to believe that she all of a sudden wanted to score political points? I bet you lot forgot about how the laptop of her staffers were hacked or how the investigators working on this report were harassed up to the point of having a formal referral opened against them with the DoJ accusing the of stealing classified material.

Anyhoo, I just <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5850300">read this interesting tidbit</a>... <br />
<br />
<em>But, according to Feinstein on Tuesday afternoon, cold-eyed David Addington was kept entirely in the dark by the wicked CIA, which was wildly exceeding its mandate, which presumes there ever was a mandate given to it by these people, which is ludicrous. The way you know it's ludicrous is that George W. Bush, and Richard Cheney, and a whole host of others whose participation in the torture program is completely damning, are now acting out of spectacular ingratitude and excoriating the report that allowed them largely to walk away from their crimes in office. But it's not simply because they are sociopathic liars, many of them, that they are doing this. It is also because they know, by defending the CIA and the criminals within its ranks, they are defending themselves as well, not against the Congress, or against a possible invitation to the Hague, but against the CIA itself.<br />
<br />
 I have to imagine that there are a whole host of field agents out there that are pretty cheesed off about having been hung out to dry this way. I have to imagine that there are a whole host of field agents out there, the ones like that person who was cited in the report, who were destroyed by what they were ordered to do, who are wondering why the demons come out at night for them while the likes of David Addington are sleeping soundly in their beds. And this is one thing of which I am sure, as this awful day comes to a close. Some day, some way, unless it is fundamentally transformed, the CIA will have its revenge on the people who strung it up as a scapegoat today.

I feel like I owe you an explanation of why I see no problem with relying on the work done by the CIA's OIG. For my day job, I work in audit and compliance and in a past life, I have dealt with OIG types. Typically, when you're going in to do an assessment of something and you find that management has already done an assessment of that thing you are independently assessing, the natural place to start is with management's work and then building from there. If you find that management's work is not sufficient or poorly done to meet your needs then you increase the scope of your independent assessment. If you find that management has done a thorough job in their assessment and you are able to gain comfort with the level of knowledge and expertise of the assessors conducting the management's review, then you can place reliance on their work. In this case, the CIA's OIG had already done a couple of reviews of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation program and the study did not do anything professionally improper by relying on the evidence collected by the CIA's OIG during their review.  Hope that helps clarify this a little bit.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/135502" target="_self">RedShrek</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5850479" target="_self">10:17 PM</a>  on December 9 [<a href="/favorited/2/5850479" style="font-weight:normal;" title="6 users marked this as favorite">6 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Imma gonna share something personal, carefully crafted for sensitivity, empathy, love and for the 31 fucking years since we graduated from school. <small>with permission. <br />
<br />
We'll call him FishLips, because its all so very top secret and all and I'm from a foreign country that, at least back in the early years, wasn't as cosy as it is now. I guess I'd always known. Because its not just that we went to school together but that we sent birthday cards, valentines cards, thanksgiving cards, christmas and new year cards (er, there wasn't any interwebs, my children) and regular letters. If you ever stop to think that about the college major and that time when the snail mail address was in McLean VA etc etc you can colour in the dots yourselves without numbers. <br />
<br />
Otoh I do recall one fine July 4th afternoon, hanging outside by the grill, asking if indeed he were employed by the firm. And got the usual disclaimer of 'welp if i was, would I tell you' heh right whatever. Its not something you think about. Except for the times in hospital. <br />
<br />
Fastforward to 2009. <br />
<br />
He had resigned he told me. From his foreign service job. Retired on disability. 'twas some time before the CV could be declassified and he didn't know what to do with the rest of his life. These words I once read somewhere, come to me now, to describe that time. <br />
<br />
&quot;There's a hole in my soul and all the beauty is leaking out&quot;<br />
<br />
That's when we started having long talks, about the Constitution, the nation, the fact that I'd chosen to leave rather than take the passport that I was eligible for - always having discussed these with him - and finding our careful, sensitive way to some kind of an understanding that being on opposite sides of an ideological manifestation did not mean we, each of us, were bad and terrible people or enemies, just because. Like, wtf, you know? We, the people, the human beings, had known each other way before ideology and career paths and diplomacy and passport countries had silenced each of us, with the other.<br />
<br />
That conversation after the resignation from the CIA field operative job. <br />
<br />
Imma gonna leave the man his soul. I'll share with you lyrics that come to my mind right now that capture better the cost to one's soul, to realize that the &quot;job&quot; you gave your life to for 20 years, for a vision, a mission, a shining ideal, might actually have become essentially meaningless by the politics and mudslinging and the bullcrap of recent years. To realize you're not the good guy, huh? What do say when the littlest one grows up and asks what did Daddy do before he started playing with Lego all the time, Mommy? <br />

I think you already know this, but I'll elucidate it for you, anyway: In no way am I attempting to minimize the effects of the CIA report - it stands solid, if filthy, on its own. <br />
<br />
My point is only that distraction has been an effective strategy for breaking down the unity of any anti- anything movement in this country for some time, but most particularly in the last few years. Divide and conquer isn't exactly a new concept, but it still works. If enough people begin to get upset and excited and gather together and protest and make headlines and take up TV space - and they just don't QUIT - something has to be done because if it isn't, there may one day be too many of them and then there could be some real damage done to the status quo - in this case, the brotherhood of police. <br />
<br />
There's enough material in the CIA report, especially in the parts we haven't been given yet, to keep outrage alive for years, in all its forms. Yes, of course, it involves people other than Americans - uh, yes - that's the point, isn't it? Abu-Ghraib and Gitmo are stains that won't wash out; thank you, Cheney, the whole country will have to carry the shame of your let's-set-the-cat-on-fire-and-see-if-he-screams twisted form of thinking for life. <br />
<br />
But, again, my point is that there is need for outrage in BOTH issues and I don't want to see the dilution of demands for change in police policy with regard to minorities and police brutality in general - both issues demand serious action.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/130108" target="_self">aryma</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5850529" target="_self">11:39 PM</a>  on December 9 </span></div><br><br>

Welcome to Washington were we are free to be wrong and have a system to address these grievances no matter that it is flawed. We are all flawed. The we makes those flaws more human something I believe most of the world has forgotten. There is tremendous strength in admitting weakness and horror and we have only just begun the real debate of moral conduct in an increasingly unstable world and your right, the real outcome, the real reason why humans convene in the body politic is to solve problems and redress grievances that is our &quot;something else&quot;<br />
Many of the politicians don't want trials etc. why is that?<br />
Because we are all guilty. We. The people, not all. Those brave enough to resist and oppose these odious energy laden- moral compass building wars were right. Yet it continues. Why is that. I look to other countries views and find little that comforts.<br />
We means we can talk about these issues here, now and that imo is like some form of back-up democracy.<br />
<br />
So, is not addressing the issue at least the beginnings of doing something or do you have a more concrete plan which I think we could agree upon is to stop. Stop torturing. Now, have we stopped?<br />
Has anything changed since EI has been at least reduced, I know it's absurd, but is that not a step in redressing this issue?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/6915" target="_self">clavdivs</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5850532" target="_self">11:50 PM</a>  on December 9 </span></div><br><br>

Bad enough when Americans decided torture is A-okay as long as it was necessary to further their own interests; fine, many countries do it, but most of them don't pour out endless self-valorising twaddle about Cities on the Hill and American Freedom and the demigod Founding Fathers. Apparently now it doesn't have to produce results, it doesn't matter if the victim had no information to offer, or even if it was the wrong person to begin with. It'll be enthusiastically defended even if the torture actually proves to be counterproductive to your interests. <br />

<a name="5850614"></a><div class="comments">A Truth Commission in Brazil just released a report on government violence during the 20th century, and so I shared both links (ours and the CIA's) to my Facebook timeline with the comment: &quot;History happening here.&quot; An American friend interjected that it's only history happening if things change, to which I replied:<br />
<br />
<i>The point about this kind of transparency, the point about truth commissions and this notion of &quot;reporting as justice&quot; is that once we establish a certain version of facts as a fixed point in the otherwise maleable fabric of historical truth, it gains political leverage. After all, it's now The Established Truth.<br />
<br />
It's criminal to deny slavery, to deny genocides, and now it is somewhat criminal too to deny these violent acts of our governments. And that narrows down our societies' possible futures a bit, which is already a change in history in its own right.<br />
<br />
But it's up to you guys to turn this ripple into a proper wave (as it is for us here in Brazil with the report from the second link).</i><br />
<br />
I see a bit of cynicism/snark in the comments here, so I thought to cross-post that commentary here. The key elements to change here are that (1) we do not allow these truths to be denied (unless there's evidence in their contrary, which a quick skim through the comments here show there isn't so far), and (2) we crunch, narrate and amplify these messages, and make them actionable (that's the genius of Aaron Swartz's work).<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/211061" target="_self">rufb</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5850614" target="_self">5:38 AM</a>  on December 10 [<a href="/favorited/2/5850614" style="font-weight:normal;" title="3 users marked this as favorite">3 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br> 
<a name="5850672"></a><div class="comments"><strong>spitbull</strong>, i'm sorry if that comment from the overheated night before implies the involvement of professionals other than the two psychologists involved in this specific and targeted activity,  that was not my intent to miscommunicate. Looking back, I was probably (and cryptically) musing out loud about all the different professions which,  like Alfred Nobel's invention, can be used for good or evil. And, how many of these skillsets were being used in less ethical situations than originally imagined.  i.e. if you're taught the ways and means to find the buttons to push to generate  preset responses (for eg. certain disciplines of design have a long history of behavioural change embedded within them such as interior architecture etc) and you're now applying your skills for evil, its a sad thing for the entire profession and taints it's reputation,  across the world. <br />

<a name="5850841"></a><div class="comments"><em>thanks to that link, I've now read the CIA's response to the report</em><br />
<br />
Just to be clear, that report is not the CIA's response. It is the <a href="http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/study2014/sscistudy3.pdf">minority response</a> produced by Republicans on the Intelligence Committee. The CIA's response to the study's conclusions can be found in <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/CIAs_June2013_Response_to_the_SSCI_Study_on_the_Former_Detention_and_Interrogation_Program.pdf">this report from June 2013</a>.<br />
<br />
There are some differences in tone. This is from the minority Senate response:
<blockquote>When asked about the value of detainee information and whether he missed the intelligence from it, one senior CIA operator [redacted] told members, &quot;I miss it every day.&quot; We understand why.</blockquote>

And this is from Brennan's introductory letter preceding the agency response:
<blockquote>I personally remain firm in my belief that enhanced interrogation techniques are not an appropriate method to obtain intelligence and that their use impairs our ability to continue to play a leadership role in the world.</blockquote>

Additionally, the CIA response, while viewing the lack of interviews as a significant flaw, explains that it was a limitation imposed upon the Senate investigation:
<blockquote>A methodology that relied exclusively on a review of documents with no opportunity to interview participants, owing to the Department of Justice investigation of the program</blockquote>

The Republican minority response agrees that the lack of witness interviews was the result of this limitation. Neither the CIA nor the actual Republican minority response allege that this is evidence of bias.<br />
<br />
Shivohum, can you find any published sources that both (1) allege bias and (2) explain the agreed upon reason why interviews were not possible?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/142099" target="_self">compartment</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5850841" target="_self">8:45 AM</a>  on December 10 [<a href="/favorited/2/5850841" style="font-weight:normal;" title="7 users marked this as favorite">7 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br> 
<a name="5850845"></a><div class="comments">I do not agree with the position that torture people in our custody, though immoral, is sometimes justified to protect the nation's physical safety. However, to those who make that case I would argue that by that same reasoning it is neccesary to arrest and convict those who perpetuated torture in order to protect the rule of law and the moral standing of a nation. If we will torture foreigners to protect the US, surely we have the backbone to prosecute our own--in the Hague if necessary.<br />
<br />
The people who say the release of this report endangers us by revealing what we have done will surely agree that prosecutions will make us safer by showing we take these crimes seriously.<br />

In the future, anyone who tortures should know with rock solid certainty that they will someday be imprisoned for it.

<a name="5850900"></a><div class="comments">Here's a good question: Where did the torture program come from? Who proposed it, and why? This is what John Yoo says <a href="http://time.com/3626957/yoo-senate-torture-report-feinstein/">in a recent editorial</a>: <br />
 
<blockquote>After the late 2001 capture of al Qaeda facilitator Abu Zubaida, whose refusal to cooperate first raised the question of interrogation methods</blockquote>

Yoo is rehashing an old claim that we've heard before. From the SSCI report:
<blockquote>In early June 2002, the CIA interrogation team recommended that Abu Zubaydah spend several weeks in isolation while the interrogation team members departed the facility &quot;as a means of keeping [Abu Zubaydah] off-balance and to allow the team needed time off for a break and to attend to personal matters ... As a result, from June 18, 2002, through August 4, 2002, Abu Zubaydah spent 47 days in isolation without being asked any questions ... The CIA would later represent publicly—as well as in classified settings—that during the use of &quot;established US Government interrogation techniques,&quot; Abu Zubaydah &quot;stopped all cooperation&quot; in June 2002, requiring the development of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA records do not support this assertion.</blockquote>

I would be interested if anyone can find anything in the CIA or minority responses refuting this claim. I searched but came up empty. Basically, the SSCI report alleges that the CIA placed Abu Zubaydah in isolation, did not ask him any questions, freaking <em>went home</em>, framed this as a refusal to cooperate, and used it as a rationale to develop a torture program.<br />
<br />
That's some crazy shit.<br />
<br />
<small>Also, Yoo says that &quot;refusing to interview&quot; involved parties &quot;clearly shows the bias inherent in the investigation,&quot; but he fails to disclose the reason why he was not interviewed.

I was mad at first because the Bush Administration was definitely culpable, right to the top. But there's no point in going after them now; no one in Washington will ever prosecute them. The CIA still exists though, and the people in the CIA who performed and approved this torture is there. Putting the focus on them means there's a chance for actual change.<br />

<a name="5851133"></a><div class="comments"><em>I feel like I owe you an explanation of why I see no problem with relying on the work done by the CIA's OIG.</em><br />
<br />
I appreciate your clarification, but I disagree.<br />
<br />
<em>Typically, when you're going in to do an assessment of something and you find that management has already done an assessment of that thing you are independently assessing, the natural place to start is with management's work and then building from there. If you find that management's work is not sufficient or poorly done to meet your needs then you increase the scope of your independent assessment.</em><br />
<br />
Well first of all I'd draw a pretty clear distinction between an auditor (or an IG) relying on <em>management's</em> assessment and this committee relying on an IG's assessment. The IG is not &quot;management&quot; at the CIA; it's independent, as you probably know, and IGs can often be antagonistic to the agencies they oversee. If <em>management</em> commissioned a report, then at least you might have some sense that management has taken care to see that its point of view is reasonably fairly represented.<br />
<br />
Second, the Senate Committee was creating a massive report meant to be a kind of final word on an incredibly important, divisive, and secretive program. How could it possibly know whether the OIG had done a &quot;sufficient&quot; job if they didn't ask even elementary questions of the most important decision-makers in the program they're writing about?<br />
<br />
Third, this was not a routine assessment. This was meant to be a landmark paper with huge public implications. Not to talk to people like Rodriguez or Hayden at all opens the Committee up to all-too-predictable charges. And as a result they've undermined the legitimacy of their conclusions, because, as phaedon points out above, the CIA is now saying: &quot;They didn't talk to anyone in the program. The program did generate a lot of valuable, actionable intelligence. The report is simply wrong.&quot;<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/19597" target="_self">shivohum</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5851133" target="_self">11:09 AM</a>  on December 10 </span></div><br><br>

<blockquote>I do not need to read the report to know that the Democratic staff alone wrote it. The Republicans checked out early when they determined that their counterparts started out with the premise that the CIA was guilty and then worked to prove it.<br />
...<br />
I have participated in two extensive investigations into intelligence failures, once when Aldrich Ames was discovered to be spying for Russia after he had done substantial damage to our human intelligence collection capability and another following the 9/11 attacks. In both cases we were very critical of the practices of the intelligence agencies. In both cases we avoided partisan pressure to blame the opposing party. <br />
...<br />
In both of these efforts the committee staff examined documents and interviewed all of the individuals involved. The Senate's Intelligence Committee staff chose to interview no one...Fairness should dictate that the examination of documents alone do not eliminate the need for interviews conducted by the investigators. Isolated emails, memos and transcripts can look much different when there is no context or perspective provided by those who sent, received or recorded them. <br />
...<br />
The worse consequence of a partisan report can be seen in this disturbing fact: It contains no recommendations. This is perhaps the most significant missed opportunity, because no one would claim the program was perfect or without its problems. But equally, no one with real experience would claim it was the completely ineffective and superfluous effort this report alleges.</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/19597" target="_self">shivohum</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5851151" target="_self">11:25 AM</a>  on December 10 </span></div><br><br>

1. An average american thinks about it like this: &quot;If you tie me up, put a pair of pliers in front of me and look at me suggestively, I will tell you my ATM pin number, passwords, etc. Why won't this work for some terrorists?&quot;<br />
<br />
2. &quot;Under torture, the suspect will tell you what you want to hear.&quot; - In some cases answers can be checked quickly, e.g. what is the address where you accomplices are, what is the address where the weapons are?<br />

I think if these 2 points are addressed, vast majority of Americans will be against torture.<br />

Gee - y'think? <br />
<br />
You have a whole pile of Bush administration people who are guilty to the max of war crimes and crimes against humanity - years and years of torture, thousands of dead due to Bush's war to kill Hussein; Cheney and his mercenary connections, warmongering and underhanded dirty deals; Rumsfeld and Ashcroft driving the bus and answering to no one under the guise of &quot;security&quot;; and lovely Condi, the token woman, classy lady with a (virtual) bloody stiletto in her purse - and what are you on about? <br />
<br />
Obama. <br />
<br />
Obama needs to arrest everybody and send them to the Hague, Which isn't within his power in the first place. <br />
<br />
True, he can order whatever kind of investigation necessary to bring all these creeps to justice - yes, he can do that - at <em>tremendous</em> cost, involving court procedures and defense attorneys and prosecuting attorneys and hearings and a full-blown media circus, off-the-wall Republican frenzy and fury and rage from middle-of-the-road Americans who can see clearly that none of it has any point because there's no way any of them are going to end up at the Hague - ever. That's reality, even though it's awful - it's still not half as horrible as the Bush administration's doings. <br />
<br />
Read something a little while ago that said that if Obama should choose to pardon the Bush Gang, that would make them criminals - per the ACLU. That might be the most sensible thing of all because at least it would leave them labeled as criminals instead of leaving them labeled as a poor, misunderstood Republican President and his VIPs who have been attacked and demeaned by the evil Democrat Barack Obama. It's a moral compromise, which no one wants to see, but it's a tiny bit of punishment that could become reality compared to what they deserve, which will never happen.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/130108" target="_self">aryma</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5851395" target="_self">1:51 PM</a>  on December 10 [<a href="/favorited/2/5851395" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Well, since Rodriguez and the CIA are clearly happy to step forward into the public discussion now, I look forward to the forthright, detailed, documented, and verified report from them on who was tortured, how, the exact actionable intelligence that was yielded, and the outcomes it prevented. <br />
<br />
It won't change my mind on whether or not torture should be legal (even *if* it's occasionally useful, it's arguable it should remain illegal and would-be patriots who need to employ it <i>in extremis</i> can make the calculation about whether paying the legal price is worth it).

If that's true, I'd think the near-constant barrage of &quot;justifiable torture&quot; scenarios in network and cable TV shows has played a major role in inuring people to the idea. It's not just 24. I've seen justifiable torture scenarios on so many shows over the years since the torture news first broke, it's absurd.<br />
<br />
We used to be a nation of people who at least aspired to high ideals. Now we just keep lowering the bar further and further and then saying it's okay because, well, we just keep saying that's okay.<br />
<br />
We're in a very dangerous downward spiral when it comes to illegitimate use of state authority that's feeding itself at this point.

<blockquote>

After the April 15, 2005 National Security Principals Committee meeting, the CIA drafted an extensive document describing the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program for an anticipated media campaign. [...] Referring to CIA efforts to deny Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for previously acknowledged information, the attorney noted that, “[o]ur Glomar fig leaf is getting pretty thin.”  Another CIA attorney noted that the draft “makes the [legal] declaration I just wrote about the secrecy of the interrogation program a work of fiction.”<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
The agency was telling the courts that nothing could be disclosed about its torture program without compromising national security, but at the same time, it was providing quotations and “facts” to the media in order to persuade the public that its activities were lawful, necessary and effective.<br />

Torture was the single biggest reason why I stopped watching Agents of SHIELD. I wanted so much to like that show. I could forgive the sloppy writing and other silliness. But all through Season One, I don't think I saw a single interrogation that didn't involve physical threats or force. The cast talked about it blithely.<br />

And I don't think for a moment this was done to show a &quot;gritty&quot; show with moral grey areas. The writers clearly envision the cast as the good guys. It's not a morally grey show; it's a show written by people with no moral compass at all.<br />

In the article, Vistica writes, &quot;Did Kerrey and his men commit crimes of war, or were they just applying the basic rules of a dirty war as best they understood them?&quot;<br />

The reported role of the psychologists is particularly distressing for the association, Farberman said. “If these allegations are true, they are clear violations of all of our professional ethics and all of what the discipline stands for.”<br />
<br />
The response wasn’t altogether unexpected. The so-called ‘torture report’ raises a sensitive issue for the APA, which has been accused of en​abling psychologists to aid in the development and implementation of these interrogative techniques. (By contrast, the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association told members that participation would violate their ethical guidelines.)<br />
<br />
The association spent years denying and evading these accusations, but finally agreed last month to hire an external attorney—Chicago lawyer David Hoffman—to conduct an investigation into the APA’s actions and determine whether or not it enabled the government to torture its war prisoners.<br />

<blockquote>

You should read the whole post here, but to summarize, Schindler argues that releasing the report without bipartisan backing guarantees that Republicans will oppose (necessary) CIA reforms, that a great deal of information about the agency's malfeasance had already been made known to the public (and was perhaps even approved by Congress itself), that releasing the details of the United States' cooperation with foreign intelligence services will make them less likely to cooperate with us in the future, and that open partisan condemnation will encourage the CIA's most cautious, self-protecting impulses.<br />

<a name="5852095"></a><div class="comments">From pages 109–110 of the report:<blockquote>After 56 hours of standing sleep deprivation, Arsala Khan was described as barely able to enunciate, and being &quot;visibly shaken by his hallucinations depicting dogs mauling and killing his sons and family.&quot; According to CIA cables, Arsala Khan &quot;stated that [the interrogator] was responsible for killing them and feeding them to the dogs.&quot;<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
After approximately a month of detention and the extensive use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on Arsala Khan, the CIA concluded that the &quot;detainee Arsala Khan does not appear to be the subject involved in... current plans or activities against U.S. personnel or facilities,&quot; and recommended that he be released to his village with a cash payment. CIA interrogators at DETENTION SITE COBALT instead transferred him to U.S. military custody, where he was held for an additional four years...</blockquote>

How could this happen, you might ask. Well, they basically didn't know how many prisoners they had, or (very often) why they had them. After they noticed this fact, the CIA requested that the station count their prisoners. Their response, in a cable dated December 2003: <blockquote>&quot;In the process of this research, we have made the unsettling discovery that we are holding a number of detainees about whom we know very little. The majority of [CIA] detainees in [Country | | have not been debriefed for months and, in some cases, for over a year.</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/40518" target="_self">Joe in Australia</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5852095" target="_self">2:02 AM</a>  on December 11 [<a href="/favorited/2/5852095" style="font-weight:normal;" title="6 users marked this as favorite">6 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Why are they showing images from 9/11 during a discussion of the torture report? Why are they shaking their heads disapprovingly? Why are they focusing almost exclusively on how the world will react to this horrible findings, rather than on the findings themselves?<br />
<br />
I mean, I actually know the answer to these questions, but still…<br />
<br />
What gets me is that the pretty universal reaction from conservatives is that we shouldn't let people who are potentially our enemies know about the bad things we've done, or they'll get angry at us. It's reminds me of the South Park episode where all of the gathered Catholic priests were up in arms about the terrible problem of child abuse — that being, that the abusers were reporting the abuse rather than keeping silent.<br />

<a name="5852412"></a><div class="comments">What kills me is that all this stuff about the US training torturers and supporting torture regimes was <i>well known</i> in this country in the eighties and nineties.  People protested it, people went to jail, the FBI investigated and harassed the organizers of the protests. You <i>could know</i> about this stuff if you paid any attention.  But people could not <i>hear</i> what was being said - just like now, I guess.  You could show them all kinds of evidence and it just....didn't sink in.  I had so many, many conversations with people about this stuff, and they would nod and acknowledge your words and then just forget. <br />
<br />
For me personally, now, it's harder to see people ignore and dismiss the evidence, and it will be very hard to see all this get swept under the rug.  Back then, it was very rarely on the nightly news, there was no internet - you had either to be interested or to be a pretty serious reader of the news and foreign policy stuff in general to know what was going on.   People <i>knew</i>, important people knew, it was possible to know; now it's very hard <i>not</i> to know.  But it won't matter. Ordinary people have very little power to affect what the mighty do, even if ordinary people care about it.  It was useful, pleasant and convenient to encourage our allies to machete students to death or machine gun protesters back in the eighties; there's no reason to believe that a single person in power has more of a conscience today.  And people really don't care as long as it's not them.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/120957" target="_self">Frowner</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5852412" target="_self">8:30 AM</a>  on December 11 [<a href="/favorited/2/5852412" style="font-weight:normal;" title="10 users marked this as favorite">10 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br />
I think he probably means the governments secretly cooperating with the CIA.  If the US could end up publishing their involvement, they may choose not to risk it in the first place.<br />
<br />
<em>GE, what do you make of the Slate article.</em><br />
<br />
Oddly, I often see Schindler retweeted by respectable neocon journalists; he seems a bit out there to me, though.<br />
<br />
I found his comments about the CIA's surprising lack of experience with interrogation and their massive management and organizational problems interesting. This seems  true of <a href="http://noneofuswerelikethisbefore.com/">Abu Graib</a> as well: No one had experience with interrogation, so they just let the most sadistic soldiers start torturing prisoners. The DoD apparently had torture experts from South and Central America, but they used Iraqis to do the torturing.<br />
<br />
I don't buy his idea that the report prevents congress and the CIA from fixing their problems.  The fact that they are making this excuse shows how truly incompetent the CIA and GOP are.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Obama only used an executive order to stop torture instead of actual legislation. The next President can rescind the order at any time. I think the Democratic Party may be in shambles. Without someone like 2008 Obama, they just don't have the voters. We could easily see Republican control of all branches of congress in 2016, and their priority will be to repeal Obamacare, the Civil Rights Act, and the New Deal, and try to stop immigration demographic changes to the voting pool. The filibuster may be the only tool left for the dems for some time.<br />
<br />
So releasing the report is the only thing the Democrats can realistically do to address the torture problem until they can pass legislation again, which could be a long time.  The GOP is doubling down on torture. The international spot light the report puts on the CIA may encourage them to address their problems, though sadly it seems this may not be the case. Feinstein deserves a lot of credit. She has probably done a lot of damage to her standing in the Senate.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/148857" target="_self">Golden Eternity</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5852446" target="_self">8:43 AM</a>  on December 11 [<a href="/favorited/2/5852446" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<a name="5852659"></a><div class="comments">My Dad was an interrogator for the US Air Force. He was good at what he did, refusing officer's school, it made him a great candidate to take down officers of grade, because they didn't see him coming. When I was outraged by one thing or another &quot;they&quot; were doing he would tell me how stupid &quot;they&quot; were and I was giving them (the US Government) way too much credit. So, when I read about the agency in charge, not even knowing their inventory of souls in custody, I remember his words. <br />
<br />
Accountability is the hallmark of effective social service institutions. It is time we, as Americans, demand that from all agencies of our government. I remember when the new (relatively new) CIA building went in, with many floors undergtound and size, there was no cost accounting and no one even knew where they got the money for it. <br />
<br />
We are supposed to be one nation, united in the common goals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Our focus on forwarding the goals of certain industries the oil, the foreign mining companies, security and support services for them has veered our nation from many of its primary reasons for being. <br />
<br />
We don't have to believe or behave how &quot;the big boys&quot; say the world works. They built this, and we can deconstruct it. We can have a nation grounded and functioning within long standing, stated values. Shouting on the internet gives a feeling of action, but often it is just more data for the planners of the ongoing fiasco. <br />
<br />
The monster Dick Cheney stands up and says he is a valuable human being who was looking after us all, when he let 9/11 happen, when he went forward adjusting the oil business in Iraq with the murders of both American troops and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. He is currently patting himself on the back for the win. These architects of the war and torture policy of the Bush puppet administration, belonged then and now in jail, and laugh over their dinners at us, and slap Boehner on the back for going after Obama, and we as a nation are in the worst place we have been for a long time. I assure you we are all running from the hounds,  though it seems certain  the people of color have it worse, they always have been the lightning rod for what we as a nation are capable of. <br />
<br />
It is time to get our country in order, stop funding the offensive war schemes, fund defense, real science, real health, real education and real infrastructure. We need our monies to tend our home renewable energy sources ( I say this rather than tend our home fires, as the old saying goes.) <br />
<br />
The reprehensible greed and cowardice that created the way we &quot;defend our nation, and its &quot;interests,&quot;&quot; needs a thorough revamp. We have been set upon each other to make sure this does not happen, and I have no idea how to effect the reunification of purpose this nation so sorely needs. <br />
<br />
It is kind of late to be confronting the robbery of the American People which characterized the Bush administration. But we can change how we support overseas business. We can try criminals, even if they are wealthy, powerful and white. <br />
<br />
I take it personally torture is still occurring in a pretense of making me secure. That was never why it happened. To say our nation was terrorized by the events of 9/11 is a coward's excuse. We are not a nation of cowards. Even with the torture, I have never been convinced the events happened without complicitous oversight, from within our nation. It was the hard sell of the war economy, put to the services of the energy business. Waterboard Cheney, he'll break in under a minute and tell us all.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/17571" target="_self">Oyéah</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5852659" target="_self">10:22 AM</a>  on December 11 [<a href="/favorited/2/5852659" style="font-weight:normal;" title="5 users marked this as favorite">5 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Tina Foster, one of al-Najar’s lawyers, said she was informed of his transfer by U.S. authorities yesterday. “It’s a desperate attempt to have to avoid defending obviously the allegations in our petition that he was tortured by the CIA, that has all been confirmed by the government itself,” she said. “The timing of this is horrendous.”<br />

His condition was so wretched that a military adviser who visited the facility said any U.S. military involvement in his detention would place the military itself at risk if his treatment were ever disclosed. And yet, the CIA inspector general concluded in a later report that the interrogation of al-Najar became a model for dealing with other detainees at the Cobalt facility.</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/148857" target="_self">Golden Eternity</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5852688" target="_self">10:38 AM</a>  on December 11 [<a href="/favorited/2/5852688" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<a name="5853152"></a><div class="comments">Some time ago I took hastily arranged flight aboard a leased Gulf Stream 5 to a recently reopened airbase in Lithuania.  After this flight I found myself standing in front of a naked Pashtun man chained to a wall.  He had along  beard and had been without sleep for some time.  He was talking nonsense.  My task was to end the nonsense talk and get him to start providing information.<br />
<br />
To do this task I performed a number of carefully designed procedures.  There procedures may seem to you like torture, as they did to me when they were first described.   They are not torture.  have been assured of this by lawyers, superiors and medical professionals.  These techniques were developed by psychiatrists, who are obligated by their profession to not engage in torture.  Furthermore these techniques have been carefully reviewed by the Department of Justices just to make sure that these techniques conform to the laws and treaty obligations of the United States.<br />
<br />
This man who is chained to a wall.  He is a dangerous man.  He has been captured at great expense.  He is held in a classified facility in an allied country that was established through careful negotiations and at a tremendous cost.  It is important that we get information from this important terrorist.  <br />
<br />
Thus I followed the procedure without concern, even though I realize that to your untrained, uninitiated point of view these thing seem grotesque and morally questionable.  I proceeded to remove a plastic bag containing a medically sterilized set of wires and alligator clips.  I will attach a positive and negative wire via these clips to the man's ball sack.  I will then attach the other end into a positive and negative terminal.  I will turn a switch allowing an array of ten twelve volt car batteries to send 120 volts of direct current through the subject's ball sack for no more than 8 seconds.  The documentation and DOJ memo on this procedure is clear.  10 car batteries and only a direct current  may be used.  AC or more than 10 batteries and you are no longer engaged in a scientifically established IET protocol, you are torturing a human being.  We may not re-use the clips and wires on a second subject, lest we risk spreading disease.  We must use a fresh set from a new bag each time.  After we are finished with the session the wires and clips will be placed in a red biowaste bag and disposed of using appropriate protocols.  Would a real torturer take this care?  I doubt it.  <br />
<br />
I have no idea what he said after I applied this procedure.  I do not speak Pashtun.  Work is compartmentalized and need to know.  I don't have a need to know.  Obviously he provided important information.  I mean why else would we go through all that.  If there was no important information why expensive jet, the secret prison, the repeated application of 8 seconds of 120 volts DC to a sleep deprived Pashtun's ball sack?  A procedure part of an integrated program developed at great expense by two psychologists with Ivy League pedigrees.  Obviously he talked.  They all talked, or at least enough talked for this to make sense.   We learned important things.  This was not torture.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/39802" target="_self">humanfont</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5853152" target="_self">3:52 PM</a>  on December 11 [<a href="/favorited/2/5853152" style="font-weight:normal;" title="9 users marked this as favorite">9 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Why do I read the Drudge Report? Because I want to know what the enemy is thinking. Normally NPR is better than most, but it is still rank propaganda for the state. It's good to know what the conventional wisdom is on any given topic from many different perspectives.

I can only answer this personally, of course, but for me it's literally the only station that is bearable for my commute, which is a typical 7:30AM/5:30PM kind of thing. Any other station during this time is borderline Idiocracy-level insanity.<br />
<br />
Even so, I do find myself turning it off out of disgust more and more these days. Their subservience to traditional power structures is just shameless. I admit I probably have unrealistic expectations, but when you have a 5-minute story about torture and never use the word, then follow that up with a 5-minute interview with Glenn Close, I just.. what.. what the actual fuck? You spent zero time at all bothering to even remind listeners that we were hearing an interview with someone defending rape, murder, and torture, and instead I hear 2 fucking minutes about how Glenn Close managed a nosebleed.<br />

<br />
Senator Gillibrand's is very outspoken about sexual assault and wants to reform the way reports are handled in the military and on college campuses.  However, if she is unwilling and/or unable to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law those who tortured people in our name, the idea of her actually holding people accountable for sexual assault is empty rhetoric.<br />

She cannot wash her hands of one, and still be taken seriously on the other.  Either Due Process and the Rule of Law matter, or they don't.  <br />

The implication of the statements by Obama, King, and Yarmuth is that there is an essential, virtuous America whose purity the CIA defiled. But that’s silly. Aliens did not invade the United States on 9/11. In times of fear, war, and stress, Americans have always done things like this. In the 19th century, American slavery relied on torture. At the turn of the 20th, when America began assembling its empire overseas, the U.S. army waterboarded Filipinos during the Spanish-American War. As part of the Phoenix Program, an effort to gain intelligence during the Vietnam War, CIA-trained interrogators delivered electric shocks to the genitals of some Vietnamese communists, and raped, starved, and beat others.<br />
<br />
America has tortured throughout its history. And every time it has, some Americans have justified the brutality as necessary to protect the country from a savage enemy. <br />

..as Jessen’s notes explain, torture was used to “exploit” detainees, that is, to break them down physically and mentally, in order to get them to “collaborate” with government authorities.

Perhaps it was the mindset of the leaders of this conflict.  Men who saw this not just in pragmatic, tactile terms.  Men who saw this as an appocolyptic battle, at a biblical level.

Bush’s fault.’ ” To Cruz and other Republicans still in office, the allegation that the Bush administration used torture had gone from outrageous smear to tired news without ever having passed through the stage of acceptable topic of discussion. Senator Marco Rubio insisted on Twitter, “Those who served us in aftermath of 9/11 deserve our thanks not one-sided partisan Senate report that now places American lives in danger.” Rubio’s previous tweet boasted that the Senate has passed “our bill imposing sanctions against human-rights violators” in Venezuela.

As to the more general question of how they compartmentalize, the people doing the torturing don't see it as an evil act.

It's certainly true that while torture is an appallingly inefficient way of procuring usable information, it's a very effect method for gathering confessions, especially if the actual guilt of the person giving the confession can't be relied on. If we are to assume that the CIA aren't idiots, we can only conclude that their intention was the latter rather than the former.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/9194" target="_self">Grangousier</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5854735" target="_self">4:11 PM</a>  on December 12 [<a href="/favorited/2/5854735" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

So any communication that employs metaphor, irony, or double entendre, then? I mean, depending on the interpretation of the judge on the bench at the time. Only approved speech patterns that aren't &quot;double-minded,&quot; or metacognitive, will be allowed soon. We're squeezing all complex thought out of public life, bit by bit, in ways both obvious and subtle now. /triedtomakeajokebutjustfelttoobitter<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/39114" target="_self">saulgoodman</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5854869" target="_self">7:08 PM</a>  on December 12 [<a href="/favorited/2/5854869" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Personally, I believe the NSA and CIA -- at the very least, but probably including several other shadowy US intelligence organizations -- should be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbfMkh940Q">nuked from orbit</a>.  And since they break laws and lie to Congress with impunity, there seems to be no way of holding them to account short of some vigilante justice.  Hack away, I say.

<a name="5855220"></a><div class="comments">&quot;Let's overthink this plate of beans&quot;<br />
<br />
At least it is a plate of beans, and not a pastry bag 'o beans. <br />
<br />
We the people have been doing the awful all over the world for some time to create and facilitate businesses, legal or illegal. One company insider discussed our doings in South America in the sixties, I think it was Agee. The alphabet soup forms in the Ivy League,&quot; American Interests&quot; they serve are buiness interests, especially setting up governments who allow resource exploitation. We the people have been walking all over the indigenous peoples of the world, and hurting the well being of nations a long time. Currently we are going after the Apache sacred lands in North Easten Arizona, and in a strange twist giving Native American lands to a foreign corporation.<br />
<br />
We the people should think over who we serve with this dark Rube Goldberg, contraption. It is amazing to see the victims of our torture practices, taken in by the tearful survivors of torture.<br />
<br />
Unless there is serious and prolonged public outcry, we the people will continue to function as a criminal enterprise, the biggest and baddest bullies on earth. This system is so sick and endemic and self serving, it utterly mocks reason anymore. <br />
<br />
If you can, turn this sucker inside out. Reveal every seeming corporation, that is actually a cover, reveal every drug cartel that actually is a money making arm, make sure all the teen bootcamp schools anywhere are not staffed, owned or run by torturers. Get our people back inside the US, and change the way we do business. <br />
<br />
This global BS we the people are now enslaved by, these oil alliances, mining alliances, military dictatorial alliances, the bullying for the .01 percent does not serve the planet or life. <br />
<br />
What is the goal of this system? The end product? A big spaceport, we have mined the Ringwoodite, sold the extra ocean water, the lucky can go somewhere that is still alive? Everyone in the global service caste must wear a jumpsuit of a certain color? How does this story progress say in fifty years? I think the powers that be, allow forward thinking conferences where they make pretty pictures of Tesla's stuff, and so forth, and use these people like decorations for parties, where they all gather and wear their new stuff, designed by millenials, but still dig up Alberta, and girdle our grasslands our grainlands with potenial disaster.<br />
<br />
Then we try to teach anti-bullying curriculum in schools, when in fact bullying is the defacto means by which we the people operate. You can wrap yourself in your impotence, and smallness and say we don't do this, but we allowed it and therefore we do. I lived as a child in West Germany in the early fifties. The German people (whom I liked then, and whom I admire now) all claimed to have fought on the eastern front. We the people can not say we didn't torture. We the people can not point to some convention that says punishing individuals by solitary confinement, rape, anal anything, amateur electric memory reassignment, genital anything, anything under 60 degrees, or over 95 degrees for that matter, harm to family, is OK or justifiable. <br />
<br />
We the have to call court on our employees who have taken to criminal practices. We the people have to let our employees know they are fired. We the people must let our erstwhile managers know we think them guilty of murder, torture, misuse of funds, and resources. We the people should prosecute, and jail these former managers, and in the process find out what they tried to cover up in these processes. Then we have to move off this entire paradigm and become what we imagine we are, a great nation, the land of the free, a beacon of creativity and compassion and reason. <br />
<br />
I love this place, but the shadow management sucks. We the people should not be defined by such as these, sham, would be patriots and heroes. We have plenty of real patriots, real heroes who serve the the people and well being of our nation. I honor and commend all sacrifices, everyone who tried to make sense of 9/11, every life lost. These &quot;would be heroes&quot; paint us as a nation of cowards and bullies, murders, manipulators, global shakedown artists. We the people are not this, we should not succumb to helplessness on this or any other issue of national identity.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/17571" target="_self">Oyéah</a> at <a href="/145175/CIA-Torture-Report-Released#5855220" target="_self">9:58 AM</a>  on December 13 </span></div><br><br>

<blockquote>

...the report raises a daunting question about a uniquely American dilemma: How can a colossus power, an empire in fact with strategic and economic interests all over the world reconcile defending these interests with maintaining its democratic ethos?<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Most Arab states were members in this confederacy of torturers. It is as if their motto was: we torture your prisoners, so that we can torture our prisoners with impunity, now that we are partners in crime. The “extraordinary rendition” program, suspended by President Obama, meant that the U.S. during the presidency of George W. Bush had pioneered what might be called the “globalization of torture” by using a wide international network of prison systems, to help capture, interrogate, transport and outsource torture to foreign government, and engage in practices it cannot engage in on American soil.<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Focusing only on the CIA and its failings during the “war on terrorism” lets the whole political class off the hook. The invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were overwhelmingly supported by the democratic members of congress. After 13 years of the invasion of Afghanistan (a worthy objective had it remained limited only to punishing Al Qaeda perpetrators and their Taliban enablers) and 11 years after the disastrous invasion of Iraq, none of the senior Bush administration officials expressed even a whiff of mea culpa. None of the people who ordered the invasions that led to the death and wounding of tens of thousands of American soldiers, and a countless number of Afghans and Iraqis is willing to own their decisions, or to engage in serious introspection or self-criticism. [...] At times the U.S. looked and behaved like a third world country: the leadership commits costly and literally bloody blunders, and everybody’s heads remained intact.<br />

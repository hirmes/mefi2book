My <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/110843">dad</a> put a have-a-heart trap out for the most recent mouse, baited with a peanut butter covered ritz cracker. When he caught the mouse, he took it out to the woodpile in the backyard and left it there, with the original bait peanut butter cracker AND, because he felt bad for taking it out of its nice, comfortable, warm spot under the oven, gave it a few more crackers for good measure.</blockquote><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/91263" target="_self">ChuraChura</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5786745" target="_self">7:17 AM</a>  on October 23 [<a href="/favorited/2/5786745" style="font-weight:normal;" title="18 users marked this as favorite">18 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Literally, he handed me a bag that contained the entire contents of his sock drawer, plus about a dozen pairs that had never been opened.<br />
<br />
I still haven't gotten an explanation for this that makes sense, but it apparently arose from some comment my mom made about him buying expensive socks that were too tight.  Or something.  I have a weird family.  <br />
<br />
They're brightly colored, made of wool, and very comfortable.<br />

<small>Also, reading this thread is making me tear up a bit, especially after just having read the old dog thread.

<br />
All routes from point A to point B take &quot;oh, about 20 minutes&quot; in my dad's mind. In reality that can mean anywhere from 5 minutes to two hours.  When I come back and tell him &quot;Dad, that was NOT 20 minutes!&quot; he will say that I drive too fast/slow and that I should have taken one of his other options.  Preferably the one by the car wash, did I notice that my car was dirty and could use a wash?  It helps the car to run better.<br />

I would stop asking him directions and just use my phone, but I think it gives him great pride to know at least three ways how to get &quot;to anywhere, from anywhere&quot; in 20 minutes.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/129348" target="_self">Elly Vortex</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5786788" target="_self">7:33 AM</a>  on October 23 [<a href="/favorited/2/5786788" style="font-weight:normal;" title="32 users marked this as favorite">32 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

You know when a dad says something faintly weird or embarrassing, and you kind of roll your eyes or cringe a little?  He is, I'm convinced, the greatest dealer in this that has ever lived.  <br />

I'd heard stories about his Maneuvers for years before meeting him, and about a year ago, I spent a week at my friend's family's house, where I got to observe him up close.  I learned so much.  It was like going to one of those Rock And Roll fantasy camps, except for being annoying.  It was like flying off to France to study culinary techniques under a master chef.  It was like trekking deep into the desert to hear the esoteric knowledge of a Gnostic High Priest.  <br />

I will preface my story by mentioning that I'm mostly unaware of pop culture. I don't watch much tv or see many movies. All kinds of things are going on out there, and I am blissfully unaware!<br />

I had met most of their friends as far as I knew, so I was wondering who they were talking about. It was all &quot;Ed did this&quot; and &quot;Ed said that&quot;, and &quot;Ed blah blah blah...&quot; This went on for a while and I was curious as to who this Ed kid was. No doubt he was yet another teenage moron.<br />

I turned around to them and asked, &quot;Who is this Ed Hardy guy?&quot; to howls of laughter and disbelief.<br />

So, the local Top 40 station had a thing where if you called in and knew the top 5 songs (which they had just played), you'd win a CD or something. My brother always wanted to do this, but you had to be 18, so he'd write the songs down get my dad to call in for him. <br />
<br />
One time, my dad got through on the phone.  When asked what the number 3 song that week was, my dad, in his best phone voice, which is very crisp and professional, enunciated &quot;Getting Jiggy With It&quot;.  Not &quot;Gettin' Jiggy Wit It&quot;.  There was no rush.  He wanted to communicate clearly for his dear son.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; asked the highly amused DJ.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get-ING. Jig-gy. WiTH. It.&quot;<br />

My dad decided to take me fishing once, so he bought a boat. <br />
<br />
And I don't mean like a little rowboat or something, I mean an honest-to-god bass boat with all the trimmings (do boats have trimmings? whatever). And then we went and bought really high-end fishing poles and stuff like carbon fiber rods and professional grade reels and those fancy artificial baits and lures and so forth. <br />
<br />
This took about 2 weeks of planning and going to look at boats and going to weird fishing shops down by the gulf run by salty and odd men because he was from the &quot;If we're gonna DO IT we're gonna do it RIGHT GODDAMMIT!&quot; school of Dad. <br />
<br />
So we finally got our bass boat and our high-end fishing rods and we had to get up before dawn because you can only fish when it's still dark out or at Oh God Thirty and we went out with thousands of dollars worth of equipment and didn't catch a damn thing. <br />
<br />
And that was the only time we went fishing because &quot;I'LL BE DAMNED IF I GET UP AT 3AM AND NOT CATCH ANYTHING.&quot;<br />
<br />
(As an amusing footnote, my mom would periodically take the kids fishing with Wal-Mart poles and whatever the weird dude at the bait shop said was good and we'd ALWAYS catch something)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/133102" target="_self">Ghostride The Whip</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5786936" target="_self">8:33 AM</a>  on October 23 [<a href="/favorited/2/5786936" style="font-weight:normal;" title="6 users marked this as favorite">6 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<a name="5786977"></a><div class="comments">My mother is 5'10&quot; and almost all legs.  My father is 5'8&quot; and long-torsoed.  Despite this, he somehow walks twice as fast as my mother and has a great habit of leaving her (and usually me, if I happen to be with them) far behind at any place that involves a lot of walking.  (At some point he took up photography and it all evened out because he'd have to spend five minutes setting up a photograph and by the time he got done, my mother and her leisurely amble could catch up.)<br />
<br />
He's a good photographer and a good gardener but it's all practical and no conceptual.  I think one of our records for the most-Dad he's ever been was set when he was muttering about how nice the blue and red &quot;pansies, I guess you'd call them&quot; outside the restaurant were.  Took my mother and I a few minutes to equate said blue and red pansies with the pink and purple petunias in the outdoor planters.<br />
<br />
Also, he is selectively deaf except for any matters that involve his mother.  I remember as a child asking my mother what my grandma's middle name was.  She wasn't sure.  My father, from two rooms away, shouted &quot;Veronica Clementine!&quot;  I guarantee if we'd asked him a different question while standing right next to him, he wouldn't have heard it.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/18783" target="_self">dlugoczaj</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5786977" target="_self">8:51 AM</a>  on October 23 [<a href="/favorited/2/5786977" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<blockquote> Hector stretched his hands out for his son,<br />
But the boy shrank back and clung to the breast<br />
Of his richly-girdled nurse, crying out.<br />
He was terrified at the sight of his own father,<br />
terrified of the bronze helm with the fearful horse-hair plume.<br />
Hector laughed, Andromache too.<br />
And glorious Hector pulled his glittering helmet off<br />
He set it on the ground. He kissed his dear son,<br />
Holding him in his arms. Then he prayed.<br />
This was his prayer to Zeus and the immortals:<br />
<strong>&quot;Zeus and all you other gods grant this my prayer.<br />
Grant that my son, may grow up to be, like me<br />
First among the Trojans, as strong and brave as me.<br />
Grant that he may rule Troy with strength.<br />
And grant that men shall say of him,<br />
'He is a far better man than his father.&quot;<br />

<a name="5787138"></a><div class="comments">I don't know if this is a Dad Story or just a My Dad Story, but it's the one I tell whenever I want to quickly sum up my dad's personality. He was an engineer at Marin General Hospital in the mid-90s, blue-collar, the guy who makes sure the air conditioning and the boilers and everything are in working order. So one day they were filming one of the opening scenes of the movie Jack (with Robin Williams) there, and they needed someone from the hospital to be there to make sure the lights were working and stuff, but generally just to stand there and wait around and make sure nothing went wrong. Somehow my dad was chosen for this, and so he stands there for a while watching the crews setting up and people running around, and all the ego and inefficiency and whatnot that's generally on display at a film shoot, and getting crankier and crankier as the hours drag on, and finally he goes up to some other guy who's standing around by himself and says &quot;Geez, this film stuff is all a bunch of bullshit, huh?&quot; thinking he'll be sympathetic. Instead the guy got really offended and walked off.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it was the director. And I just looked up that movie, curious for the first time since I've been re-telling that story who the director actually was, and it was Francis Ford Coppola.

<a name="5787180"></a><div class="comments">Aw geez, I actually think this is my dad's biggest dad thing: My dad has these things with birthday cards. On his kids' birthdays, he expects a &quot;thank you&quot; card. If you forget, he'll call and ask why he didn't get one. Also, my mom will call to ask what I want for my birthday, and then my dad will take the phone to tell me what he wants for his &quot;thank-you present.&quot;<br />
<br />
And sometimes instead of birthday cards, he'll send us &quot;Congratulations!&quot; cards, and inside will be a congratulations message on being born with a father like him.<br />
<br />
For everyone in his life, my dad takes birthday and holiday cards that people sent to him, crosses out and replaces the relevant information, crosses out<em> just</em> the names in the message, and  and then sends them <em>back</em> on your birthday.<br />
<br />
So everybody gets cards like this: <br />
Front: Happy <del>Father's Day</del> birthday, <del>Dad</del> Daughter <br />
Inside written message: <em>Hey <del>Dad</del> barchan, Have a great father's day, we can't wait to see you next week! We hope you like your new ax.  Tell Mom to give you a hug from us. We love you, [barchan spouse] &amp; <del>barchan</del> Daddy</em><br />

<a name="5787310"></a><div class="comments">Some dad incidents:<br />
<br>
<ul>
<li> When I was very young, I had a condition involving my sternocleidomastoid muscle that could be corrected (after a surgery) by me sleeping on one side of my face instead of the other. I'd always fall asleep and then move into the wrong position. So, he took a small plastic pipe and screwed my hair into it on the side of my head that I shouldn't be sleeping. I didn't sleep on it because it's uncomfortable to sleep on a tiny plastic pipe.

Later on, he substituted Lego bricks.</li>

<br>

<li>While fairly progressive for a Korean man of his age, he never learned to cook and still believes it's not worth learning to cook.

The only thing he ever voluntarily cooked was a weird fried cheese thing that smelled so bad it would literally drive me out of the house. Literally, he'd butter up a pan, then fry American cheese in it until it was hard-ish discs. He and my sister loved it. 

He also had trouble making us Spaghetti-Os. When my mom went on a trip, he had to call her up to ask for guidance because he had added tons of water for some reason, and the pot boiled over.

Recently, when my mom went overseas to help my sister with a new baby, my mom left him with pre-made rice that he could just scoop microwave. He was so bizarrely intimidated by even that level of cooking that he instead went to the grocery store to buy sushi. He is both cheap and hates sashimi. He just did it so he could eat the rice.
</li>

<br>

<li>In high school, I started playing guitar. I spent a lot of time struggling to play thrash metal. If you've heard this stuff, it's intricate in some particular ways, but tends to lean heavily on the palm-muted low E. He didn't really get metal, and so took a shrugging sort of attitude toward it.

Sometimes, he'd walk in and do an impression of me that was literally just &quot;DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING&quot;. Which, you know, was fairly accurate in a sense.

Or he'd say, &quot;Why not play some other notes?&quot;
</li>

Among other idiosyncrasies my dad had very definite ideas about appropriate use of the phone. For example, you never answered the phone while eating dinner. &quot;If it's important they'll call back&quot; (this was the pre-answering machine era). He also really disliked leaving messages on answering machines for some reason. Not to long after I got my first answering machine I missed a call because I was busy washing my hands or something. Whoever it was didn't leave a message so I went on about my business. About an hour later I got another call. It was dad, saying his car had a dead battery at K-mart (his favorite store) and could I come give him a jump start. &quot;Sure, I'll be there in a few minutes.&quot;  &quot;Can you stop by the house and get me on the way?&quot;  &quot;What are you doing there?&quot;  &quot;I called earlier but no one answered so I walked home.&quot;  So my father had walked home two miles in the rain rather than leave a message on my answering machine.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/14688" target="_self">TedW</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5787561" target="_self">12:20 PM</a>  on October 23 [<a href="/favorited/2/5787561" style="font-weight:normal;" title="5 users marked this as favorite">5 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

When my kids won't do what I ask, I often start singing an endless song about the situation.

As long as we're drifting into paternal strictness about manners ... my parents would not allow me to go out to a car that honked. This was pre-cell-phones. My friends were expected to pull up, stop the car, get out, and come knock on the door. If they honked in the driveway I was not allowed to leave the house until they came to the door. My good friends knew this but casual friends tended to forget, leading to an escalating situation where they honk LOUUUUUDER and LOOOOONGER to try to get me to come out of the house and I cringe faaaaaarther and faaaaaaarther back into my own spine with embarrasment and anger and frustration with my inability to send psychic messages to them to stop honking while my parents frowns grew deeper and more scowl-like as the honking increased.<br />
<br />
My parents did very little during my teen years that was cringeworthy, and my house was a preferred hang-out spot because my parents were so nice (not &quot;cool&quot; parents but friendly to my friends, reliable providers of snacks and pizzas, tolerant of hijinks, and strict about anything straying beyond hijinks), but OH THE HORN RULE.

<a name="5787935"></a><div class="comments">One year we got a lot of snow and my dad and I (mostly my dad) built a snow fort by stuffing 5 gallon buckets with snow and using them like bricks. It was igloo-shaped and then one end looked funny so he added a snout, ears and icicle fangs and thus it became the Pigloo. I don't know why the pig had fangs.<br />
<br />
We also have a picture of me as a toddler in a snowsuit stuffed armpit-deep in a snowbank. By my dad. <br />
<br />
He has lots of his own vocabulary, like many dads I gather. &quot;Are you gonna look that up on the 'puter?&quot; &quot;Gonna pour some 'crete tomorrow, hope it sets good.&quot; Anyone who ticks him off is a &quot;honyocker.&quot; I had to look that last one up. It's some old slang for a failed farmer/homesteader. Every now and then I'll find myself exclaiming &quot;That honyocker!&quot; and no one has any idea what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
His feet get cold easily and he has a physical job standing on concrete floors. He has a whole system of socks and shoes that he rotates through during the day, warming the pairs he's not wearing by hanging them off sticks strapped to his wood stove. <br />
<br />
He never goes back to the doctor to have his stitches removed. His idea of a relaxing weekend is chopping wood or moving rocks. The last time he chopped up some green wood he told me he weighed a few representative logs and that he calculated he'd moved 2,000 pounds of wood in three days, something crazy like that.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/116385" target="_self">purple_bird</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5787935" target="_self">3:09 PM</a>  on October 23 </span></div><br><br>

<a name="5787964"></a><div class="comments">For a while, I somehow ended up being the praise group leader* at the Methodist church I attended.  Now my dad was raised Southern Baptist and grew up knowing a lot of hymns.  And parody versions of hymns, that he proceeded to teach to his daughters (along with all the words to the Georgia Tech fight song).  Many of these, I learned the parody version without ever actually learning the proper song.  For example:<br />
<br />
<i>At the bar, at the bar, where I smoked my first cigar<br />
And the money in my pockets rolled away.<br />
It was there by chance that I tore my Sunday pants<br />
And now I have to wear them every day.</i><br />
<br />
I was unaware that this was based on a hymn until our pastor chose <a href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/music/At_the_Cross_Hudson/">At the Cross</a> as one of the songs to be sung one Sunday.  I had to struggle the whole time not to sing the words I'd originally learned, while my dad sat in the congregation, grinning and clearly mouthing the parody version.<br />
<br />
He also used to pretend that he was a pizza parlor when I'd call to get a ride after play practice at high school and his favorite joke is:  &quot;What's brown and sounds like a bell?  <i>Dunnnnnnggg!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<small>*I am a pagan but I was attending church with my parents as a group activity and I like to sing hymns. The previous praise group leader had left due to Church Drama (involving the rummage sale, a lay leader sermon that didn't go over well with Certain Members of the congregation, and a series of anonymous letters presumably from those Certain Members) and I was the only one left who could read music.  I quit a few years later after an extremely stressful Christmas pageant directed by a woman with no musical knowledge who thought I could teach 6 songs with 3-part harmony in two rehearsals.  It was a whole big weird thing.</small><br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/180274" target="_self">darchildre</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5787964" target="_self">3:33 PM</a>  on October 23 [<a href="/favorited/2/5787964" style="font-weight:normal;" title="5 users marked this as favorite">5 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<a name="5788021"></a><div class="comments">At some point in his life, my dad decided that what the world needs more of is crafts made of popsicle sticks and wine corks. As a result of this decision, the homes of my parents, siblings, and extended relatives are strewn with assorted tchotchkes: Christmas wreaths made out of corks, bowls, boxes, hot plates, you name it.<br />
<br />
The best part? He doesn't go out and buy the popsicle sticks and corks from a craft store. No, he eats lots of popsicles and drinks lots of wine (&quot;it's for my hot plate, you know&quot;) and then painstakingly cleans and saves the sticky, sometimes broken, items that result. <br />
<br />
So I have a hot plate sitting on my kitchen table right now. My dad shipped it all the way to Australia from the US. It is slightly falling apart (from the shipping) and some of the corks are discoloured or slightly misshapen (from, you know, having been on wine bottles). And we don't even use hot plates, so it's just taking up space. My partner thinks I'm a little crazy for keeping it there.<br />
<br />
But man, I love that thing. I miss my dad.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/94986" target="_self">forza</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5788021" target="_self">4:21 PM</a>  on October 23 [<a href="/favorited/2/5788021" style="font-weight:normal;" title="3 users marked this as favorite">3 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br> 
<a name="5788030"></a><div class="comments">My dad has always driven a Dodge minivan. Even when he has a company truck, his minivan is his favorite means of conveyance. Modern minivans have a hundred nooks and cubbies, and there will be a pocket knife in every one of them. We joke that he’ll get into an accident and die – Cause of death? Forty-five stab wounds.<br />
<br />
My dad calls me on the phone, tells me what he wants, and asks me to buy it for him on Amazon. Then he mails me a check. Feels so wrong.<br />
<br />
My dad has cycled through several “words of wisdom” phrases he uses any time one of us kids is leaving: “Be smart” became “Be Smart. Be Good.” <br />
<br />
My dad once called his cell phone carrier to complain about free 411 going away. When the customer service rep answered the phone, my dad started in with “Well god damn it…” before the poor CSR could even say “Hello.”<br />
<br />
My dad calls my younger brother when he and my mom can’t figure out the TV. It’s usually just on the wrong input, or the cable box is off, but before my brother can instruct my dad on what buttons to pushed, dad has already mashed every button on the remote and switched the language to Chinese or something. This is all my brother’s fault.<br />
<br />
During this same “want to watch TV but can’t figure it out” episode, got furious when those of us listening in the background shouted to suggest he try reading a book instead.<br />
<br />
My dad would encourage us to run down the hall after a pre-bedtime bath yelling “SPEEEEEEEED!!!!!! SHAMMY!!!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
My dad is looking forward being old and being admitted to the hospital. He will request that he be served rainbow sherbet on pear halves every hour on the hour or he will not pay anything for his hospital stay. He has told many people this.<br />
<br />
My dad was born in 1958. He’s used computers for longer than I’ve been alive, and he’s a quick study for so many other things – why has he gotten so cantankerous already?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/8302" target="_self">Coffeemate</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5788030" target="_self">4:28 PM</a>  on October 23 [<a href="/favorited/2/5788030" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<a name="5788279"></a><div class="comments">I could tell dad stories for days, my dad is like, a Grandmaster of Dad-ness. He is an actor, and embraced the role of The Dad with gusto and is only half-joking when he tells people the best thing about having kids is it means you've got a captive audience. But for now I'll stick to just the tale of The Dad and The Smartass Teenage Son, as perhaps a cautionary tale to the folks planning to make use of this thread on their own kids:<br />
<br />
The scene: The dining room table, moments after a big holiday meal. Everyone in the family has just eaten so much they are completely stuffed and barely able to move.<br />
<br />
My Dad (super-cheerfully): &quot;Okay! Everyone out on the lawn for calisthenics!&quot;<br />
<br />
[Everyone groans, makes lame excuses, he a makes big show of sighing and shaking his head at us all for our lazy, slothful ways.]<br />
<br />
Every time, for years. Years and years. Until eventually I got old enough to be a teenager who could eat basically infinite amounts of food and not be too full, and was also a giant smartass, so I decided to call his bluff. He did the usual, &quot;Everyone out on the lawn for calisthenics!&quot; and I hopped up from the table and said, &quot;Okay! Let's go!&quot; with my biggest, smuggest, I-gotcha-now grin. My dad, of course, took this in stride immediately, grinned back just as hard and stood up and said, &quot;Great! Let's go!&quot; and we went back and forth this way - &quot;After you!&quot; &quot;No, no, after you!&quot; all the way from the dining room to the back door, one step at a time, neither one of us backing down at all.<br />
<br />
So we get to the door. It was Thanksgiving, late November, and not just cold outside, but cold, grey, and windy. On top of that, it had been steadily, relentlessly drizzling all day, with no sign of stopping. But I wasn't going to back down first, and he wasn't going to admit his perennial joke was a bluff, so much to the incredulity of everyone else in our entire extended family (all of whom gathered to peer out the kitchen windows and gawk at our incredible stupidity), there we found ourselves, out in the freezing rain on the muddy lawn doing jumping jacks until we were both wheezing, totally out of breath and soaked from head-to-toe by the rain, at which point both of us pretty much simultaneously agreed that was probably good enough and we both went back inside and (without either of us having dropped the act for even one second that this was all an eminently sensible, wise, and health-conscious idea) we made a big show out of sighing and shaking our heads at everyone else for their lazy, slothful ways.<br />
<br />
We had a couple repeat performances while I was in high school, though never on a day when the weather was quite as awful as that first time. One time we somehow even got my younger brother to join in. Then when I went off to college my parents moved to a house with a gravel patio in the back and nothing but woods in the front, so for all the many years since they moved, my dad has changed up the routine to instead go, &quot;Okay, everybody out on the lawn for calisthenics.....aww shucks [snaps fingers], we don't have a lawn.

One winter, when I was maybe eleven or twelve, there was a horrible windstorm, and the roof had come loose at one corner in a previous storm (the house was old). Without time or money to put a new roof on the house, Dad had to improvise some way to keep the storm from tearing a chunk of roof off the house. So he drove nails into the beams of the roof, and into the uprights where the wall met the roof, in maybe two or three places, and wrapped coat hanger wire between the nails. He had called me up to the attic to help, which mostly meant to watch, as far as I could tell. I don't remember actually doing anything to help him; maybe I just held a loop of wire in place so it wouldn't pop off while he was getting it started. I do remember snow blowing in through the gap when the wind gusted, though. The noise of the wind and the urgency (and strangeness) of the situation made the whole thing feel like some kind of high-stakes adventure movie for what was probably only five minutes, but felt like much longer.<br />
<br />
Another winter, snow had piled up on the porch roof, and to keep it from collapsing, he climbed out my bedroom window with a shovel. I still have a picture somewhere of Dad in his winter gear, standing in my window, shoveling out a place for himself to stand, bits of snow on my floor around his feet. There are other shots from outside, of him standing on the porch roof with a shovel, and snow up past his knees.<br />

He's an engineer/perfectionist and loves to fix things/can't stand for things to be not right. In our last apartment, the handle for the bathroom faucet came off sometimes.

I do this with car stuff, sitting on weird noises then making my dad listen to them. I also use him (and his lives-in-the-country truck having skills) to help me move stuff/take stuff to the dump.

<br />
That's my mother-in-law, but she was stuck at 29. Every year, we celebrate (the anniversary of) her 29th birthday. She tried being 41 once, but it was too old. <br />
<br />
My father-in-law is of the gruff sort, and his four daughters (and his wife) like parroting his tough love quotes. When someone's hurt, the response is either &quot;show me the blood,&quot; or &quot;it's a long way from your heart.&quot; But he's also light-hearted - when he wanted my son to go the opposite direction, he said &quot;turn around,&quot; so my son turned in a complete circle. We all laughed, because my father-in-law is also has that literal sort of humor, so his grandson just played a joke on him. <br />
<br />
For whatever reason, I can't think of too many dadisms from my own father. He isn't too much of a punster, but he does make light of a lot of situations, which are harder to re-tell if I forget the original context, as I have now. <br />
<br />
When we were kids, there was one weird little divided road segment that was maybe 20-30 feet long on our way to and from our grandparents house. Just for thrills, he'd drive on the wrong side every so often. And when we were little, there was a particular road that elicited the same song fragment every time: &quot;he's a two bump baby, bump, bump, he has two bumps on his head,&quot; with the &quot;bump, bump&quot; to the bumps in the road. Now, in the age of grandson photos on Facebook, every so often he'll post my name as a comment on my Facebook wall, which I think comes about because he's looking for my profile to find photos of my son, which makes me happy in a funny little way. <br />
<br />
I'm reveling in being a dad, and I've made my wife cringe at some of my puns, and even laugh at a few of them.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/81610" target="_self">filthy light thief</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5788674" target="_self">7:44 AM</a>  on October 24 </span></div><br><br> 
<a name="5788681"></a><div class="comments">One of the first times I took &quot;T&quot;, my now-husband, up to our cabin while my parents and brother were there, there was somehow a leak in the boat. It wouldn't leak while running the boat, but if it sat overnight, it was much deeper in the water the next morning.<br />
<br />
We needed to figure out where that leak was, but how to do that when the boat is in the lake and the trailer and truck are 40 minutes away?<br />
<br />
Dad's idea was to somehow get our boat on top of the dock down by the beach. This involved ropes and chains and pulleys and things tied to trees and at one point, my dad told T to stand behind/under the back of the boat (a 16 foot aluminum-hulled fishing boat) to &quot;catch&quot; it (?!?) if it slipped. T, having not been raised in my family, was smart enough to immediately say &quot;Oh hell no!&quot;<br />
<br />
I think it was finally gotten on the dock by using a pulley system of a rope/chain deal wrapped around the big jack pine (and maybe a big rock, too) with the other end of the rope being pulled by my dad's bigger boat.<br />
<br />
Strangely, I don't remember where my mom was at the time. Hiding in the kitchen with the first aid kit at the ready, maybe? Having been married to him for that long, I can understand how hiding in the kitchen would be much easier than actually WATCHING the whole thing play out.<br />
<br />
Unbelievably, there were little to no injuries (at least none memorable now) from the incident and the leak in the boat was found (a big gouge in the aluminum hull that we got soldered up later).<br />
<br />
My dad is awesome in the sense that he'll always try to fix something at least once. He's an engineer and many things have been broken along the way, but he loves to figure things out. I definitely think I've inherited that from him.  :)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/118957" target="_self">jillithd</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5788681" target="_self">7:49 AM</a>  on October 24 </span></div><br><br>

His dadisms were more topical (and inappropriate) in nature and definitely of the &quot;too soon&quot; variety.  Like when I was going out with friends a few days after 9/11 and he said &quot;Try not to get hit by any planes!&quot;<br />
<br />
He also is the kind of person that will go unwhere that is unlocked.  Not peoples homes and stuff but if we are at a museum, monument, stadium, etc. he will try every door.

<a name="5788721"></a><div class="comments">In my late teens and early 20s (in the mid-1990s) my Dad owned a 1971 Corvette Stingray. It was a beautiful car that we worked on together to restore (where my job was to hand him various tools and his job was to be repeatedly shocked that I didn't know the <em>real</em> names of the various tools).  He would let me drive it from time to time and it was seriously awesome.<br />
<br />
On one occasion, 19 year old me drove it to the gas station to fill the tank. The guy working there made a bunch of snide comments about how it was too much car &quot;for a woman to drive&quot; and how &quot;women can't drive stick&quot;.  <br />
<br />
When I got home, I told this story to my Dad and step-mother. My Dad silently got up, walked out of the house, and drove away. Literally without a single word.  About 20 minutes later, the phone rang and a shaky voice said, &quot;Umm.. is this VioletU?&quot;  I confirmed that it was, in fact me, and the voice said, &quot;So, I, uh, just really wanted to apologize for the comments I made earlier when you were getting gas.&quot;  I was a bit stunned but accepted the apology.<br />
<br />
20 minutes later, my Dad returned home, and claimed to have no idea what that was all about.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/75089" target="_self">VioletU</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5788721" target="_self">8:09 AM</a>  on October 24 [<a href="/favorited/2/5788721" style="font-weight:normal;" title="43 users marked this as favorite">43 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Oh man.<br />

So it's Christmas and I'm at my parents' place for the week with my girlfriend (now wife). My father asks for my help to to get the new barbeque onto the back deck. The thing is pretty big and heavy. It's so big in fact that we need to take the trim off the front door to fit it inside. Once we get it inside we realize we don't know how big the door to the deck is. Turns out the barbeque is about half a foot too big to get through that door. After some thought my dad decides we'll lean a ladder from the ground onto the deck which is a storey up, and then using a rope we'll drag the barbeque up the ladder. While we're working out the logistics like whether one of us should be under the barbeque or whether we should both be pulling on the rope my girlfriend is looking for the first aid kit and the numbers to nearby emergency services. We lift the barbeque to carry it back outside and bring it around to the deck, but as we lift it something shifts and the part I'm carrying slides into the part my dad is carrying, making it easily compact enough to fit through the deck door.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/10409" target="_self">ODiV</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5789245" target="_self">12:30 PM</a>  on October 24 [<a href="/favorited/2/5789245" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

He moved mountains to get me into Engineering college even after the whole family told him he was wasting time and money because I was just a girl who'd only get married and have babies anyway. <br />

When I got shortlisted for an extremely prestigious and competitive graduate program and was invited for further testing and interviews, we couldn't get tickets on the trains nor was there a flight available. Late in the evening, after the Indian Airlines office turned us away, we were standing outside and he turned to me asked me if I was serious about this path of study and was I sure I didn't want to get married instead. And if I was sure I wanted to study further, then he'd make things happen to get me on a flight. I was 23. It was the right time for him to be looking for boys for me. But I didn't want to get married, I was sure I wanted to go try my luck at BIGNAME program. He ran around late that night calling people who knew people and got me on a plane in time for the second round of entrance examinations *and* arranged for me to be picked up at the airport by a buddy's son who also put me up in his bachelor pad with all the courtesy of a honoured guest. <br />

<a name="5789291"></a><div class="comments">Another good Dad story..  My Dad decided to go on a cross-Canada drive (in the aforementioned Corvette, with the aforementioned step-mother) and asked if I would be willing to stay in his house for a couple of weeks while he was gone.  I complained - his house was in the middle of the countryside and I was living in Toronto for the first time. He said he'd pay for my food/groceries, leave me the keys to his non-fancy car, AND pay for gas so I could drive around and do whatever it was that I wanted to do. That seemed like a sweet deal for a 19 year old who was broke and had no car.<br />
<br />
A friend drove me home and I arrived after he had already left for his trip. On the table was a note with some of the usual information about what plants needed watering and the like. Next to that was an enormous stack of &quot;Pioneer Bonus Bucks&quot; - a form of currency invented by the gas station. On filling up your tank, you were given various denominations of &quot;bucks&quot; in proportion to a percentage of your purchase. In other words, he had left me gas money in the form of <em>hundreds</em> of little coupons, each worth ridiculous amounts like $0.05 and $0.50.  To accumulate this value of &quot;bucks&quot; he had to have been saving them for years. YEARS!   <br />
<br />
Next to the 'gas money' was a large coffee can. I opened the lid to find it filled with loonies - the $1 Canadian coin.  Hundreds of dollars in.. loonies. My grocery money was hundreds of shiny golden coins. It looked like pirate treasure.<br />
<br />
It goes without saying, I suspect, that I was totally mortified to have to pay for my gas and groceries this way. The expression on the guy at the gas station when I whipped out that 2&quot; stack of 'bucks' was classic.  <br />
<br />
It also goes without saying that my Dad probably laughed the entire way across Canada.<br />

<a name="5794849"></a><div class="comments">I doubt there's still anyone religiously watching this thread, but...<br />
<br />
There is a cure for dadisms (or at least a cure for dadisms from a particular father), and it is staring.<br />
<br />
The method is surprisingly simple. When a dad springs one of their usual gags, don't protest indignantly. Barely react, in fact. Just stare at them with an utterly empty expression. Emptiness is key, here. Something like disgust or mournfulness will only give them what they want. You want to look like at some point in the past all joy was squeezed out of you like juice from an orange. Like inertia is the only reason you do not spontaneously disintegrate into your component atoms. Peer at your dad with your head subtly tilted and your eyes half-shut by their own weight.<br />
<br />
Say nothing. Stare. Wait. Then return to whatever it is you were doing before you were diverted, ignoring the interruption. As if it never happened.<br />
<br />
The dadisms will not stop immediately, of course, but you will be able to measure your progress via your father's reaction. At first, he will cheerfully bear your unwillingness to play along. Soon, however, your lack of reaction will begin to rankle. When you stare, he will become annoyed, or even angry. He may even snap at you to &quot;smile&quot; or &quot;lighten up&quot;, as if the entire situation is somehow your fault.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the dadisms stop, or at least are redirected toward someone else.<br />
<br />
I've been much happier, since I discovered this cure.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/113392" target="_self">KChasm</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5794849" target="_self">5:14 PM</a>  on October 28 [<a href="/favorited/2/5794849" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Or are you suggesting there's someone out there whose interactions with their father come solely in the form of dadisms? Because that would be sort of messed up on its own.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/113392" target="_self">KChasm</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5798187" target="_self">3:36 PM</a>  on October 30 </span></div><br><br>

<br />
He installed the antenna right in the center of the roof.  It made my car look like some sort of discount UFO.<br />
<br />
But I'll tell ya--in the pre-cell-phone age that CB radio was the handiest thing ever.  I did use it to call for help (not for myself, but for others), and if there was a wreck on the highway I could listen to the truckers discuss out alternate routes to avoid the traffic jam.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/75846" target="_self">magstheaxe</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5798960" target="_self">8:44 AM</a>  on October 31 [<a href="/favorited/2/5798960" style="font-weight:normal;" title="1 user marked this as favorite">1 favorite</a>] </span></div><br><br> 
<a name="5804368"></a><div class="comments">Right - I've talked before about <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/254119/Feminist-basics-for-dads#3692024">PaterCallipygos' awesomeness.</a>  And I am definitely my father's daughter in terms of temperment - we just sort of really grok each other.  And yet, even he fell prey to a couple moments of Dad-ness; but one is actually kind of awesome.<br />
<br />
* First, I also posted a story about how <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/21275/Please-help-me-find-a-comment#951292">Dad isn't just a Luddite</a> - he managed to combine his computer ambivilence with Cold-War level paranoia.<br />
<br />
* Second: Okay, my parents' names actually are, in all seriousness, &quot;Dick&quot; and &quot;Jane&quot;.  And they think that that's cute as hell.  And periodically, we all find ourselves at some kind of social function where people are just meeting us all - and &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; is always how Dad introduces himself and Mom.  But - if i'm standing nearby, that becomes &quot;We're Dick and Jane .... and oh, this is our daughter Spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
* Third: this is also possibly one of my favorite Dad stories. I've mentioned that Dad likes picking intellectual debates with people for fun.  It's almost an instinct.  So - one Thanksgiving, we're all kicking back after dinner, and the talk turns to cranberries (my family is a supplier for Ocean Spray).  And for whatever year, that year the berries were just a bit more prone to spoiling faster than usual.  My grandmother was tut-tutting that, saying that she didn't understand why Ocean Spray didn't just turn everything into cranberry sauce or juice before it went bad - they should have had more corporate pride or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, wait, though,&quot; Dad suddenly said.  &quot;If the government says you're allowed to have 1% bug parts in your food, why should they make any extra effort?&quot;<br />
<br />
And grandma was shocked.  &quot;But....they should have pride in their product!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, think about it,&quot; Dad said.  &quot;if it costs more money to make everything totally perfect, and Uncle Sam says you can get away with only 99% perfect, then who cares?&quot;<br />
<br />
And suddenly one of my uncles was saying &quot;that's a good point,&quot; and one of my aunts was siding with Grandma, and then more and more people were chiming in and suddenly all 20 members of my extended family were having a lively, talking-over-each-other, gesturing-wildly debate about <em>government food purity standards.</em><br />
<br />
I just sat and watched them all a moment in amazement, and then looked over at Dad - and saw him sitting there, also watching everyone, with an enormous shit-eating &quot;Heh, look what I did!&quot; grin.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/73800" target="_self">EmpressCallipygos</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5804368" target="_self">7:18 PM</a>  on November 4 [<a href="/favorited/2/5804368" style="font-weight:normal;" title="4 users marked this as favorite">4 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br />
As for my own Dad, he always made sure to tell me and my sister which of his dad jokes were ones he'd learned from his dad. Since both my dad's parents had died in a car wreck before we were born, that gave us some small connection to them.<br />
<br />
One of my favorite dadisms happens when I'm on the phone with my mom, and she uses an approximate value for something. It doesn't matter what it is, and usually the exact value isn't necessary for the conversation, but just after she has said, &quot;Oh, there were about thirty people there,&quot; or similar, I'll hear my dad yell from some other room in the house, &quot;There were 32!&quot; He's a stickler for precision, and the phone routine is a hoot.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/63166" target="_self">ocherdraco</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5804521" target="_self">9:44 PM</a>  on November 4 [<a href="/favorited/2/5804521" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

Oh, that's actually a good story about how I got HIM good.  :-)  <br />
<br />
First, <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/110790/A-silver-sixpence-and-a-long-toffee#4093012">here's who Sam Yakaboochie is.</a>  That name's kind of been a family touchstone for several years now; last year Dad turned 70, but I was too broke for a big splashy gift.  So I enlisted some friends and volunteers to all send my father birthday cards, saying something to the effect that &quot;I'm friends with Sam Yakaboochie too, and he told me it was your birthday!&quot;  One of the people sending a card even spun an elaborate story about the two of them having worked a trapeze act in France or something.  <br />
<br />
He was delighted, if a bit overwhelmed (at about noon on his birthday, he tracked me down where I was working and called me, pleading &quot;CALL OFF THE DOGS!&quot;)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/73800" target="_self">EmpressCallipygos</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5805432" target="_self">12:43 PM</a>  on November 5 [<a href="/favorited/2/5805432" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br />
I have a theory about dad-isms. When your kids are growing up, there are developmental windows when the stupidest jokes are the most hilarious thing to your kids. It's a great button to push and it's fun for everyone, but the kids outgrow the jokes way too fast, but you remember the joy you got the first time you told your kid that s/he had snew on her/his face (&quot;nothing much, what's snew with you?&quot;). Sometimes the button is pushed because the joke is just totally over your kid's head.<br />
<br />
My dad had other ways of handling things. My brother, who ended up being a concert quality pianist, was playing Liszt in high school. IIRC, my mom was able to get 1 and only one ticket to see Vladimir Horowitz at Carnegie Hall (which is another story in and of itself). My dad took him to the concert and wandered around where he could go until the show was over. During his wandering, he found where the green room was and after the show he got my brother and said, &quot;would you like to meet Vladimir Horowitz? He's an old friend of mine.&quot; My brother smelled bullshit in my dad's tone and followed him...to the green room to meet him.<br />
<br />
Several years later, I was a fairly solid trumpet player and there was a concert at Carnegie hall performed by Maurice Andr&eacute;, a virtuoso if there ever was one. We watched the concert in awe and my dad pulled the same shit on me too. And when I saw Maurice Andr&eacute; I gaped in awe. Dad noted during the concert that he had a translator working for him and put a hand on my shoulder and said &quot;&eacute;tudiant&quot; in a truly horrible French accent and shoved me forward.<br />
<br />
I pull the dad jokes on my kids all the time. In fact, today I picked up the kids at school and I remarked on the rain saying, &quot;Alice - it's raining cats and dogs out there. You know how I know? Stuart stepped in a poodle.&quot; Once again, my feedback mechanism works - both kids called me &quot;Daaaaaad&quot; with at least 2 extra syllables. Score. Alice said, &quot;no dad, is not a poodle, it's a PUDDLE.&quot; My son said, &quot;dad, you know that raining cats and dogs is just a metaphor, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, Stuart, I did know that and I'm amazed that you could articulate that at age 7.<br />
<br />
Yes, when they burp I say, &quot;Must be a barge coming through.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, I call them noodles and nuggets and ask them to &quot;butter up, buckle cup&quot; when getting in the car.<br />
<br />
Last April fool's day, I convinced my son that his middle name is actually 'Danger'. I made up a story about them making a mistake in the hospital and I made a near perfect copy of his actual birth certificate (you know, if the town hall uses Courier and Courier Bold for the text and a relatively common heavyweight cream for the paper, it's just so easy - I didn't bother with the seal - that would be forgery) which is waiting in the fire safe for the day he calls me on it.<br />
<br />
And then some day in a few years we'll watch Austin Powers (or some other context that has it) and then the Long Troll will be complete.<br />
<br />
I love you Stuart. Don't forget that.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/549" target="_self">plinth</a> at <a href="/143848/hassled-by-the-cops-for-taking-too-many-photographs-of-freight-trains#5807414" target="_self">1:55 PM</a>  on November 6 [<a href="/favorited/2/5807414" style="font-weight:normal;" title="7 users marked this as favorite">7 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>
